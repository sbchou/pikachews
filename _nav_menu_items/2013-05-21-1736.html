<p>In cooking, as in life, I try to keep it simple because as a high school senior freshman sophomore in college, life is often more than complicated. Although baking is my forte, I enjoy making dinner on occasion, with an emphasis on fresh and healthy foods. I love cats and plants, and cute things make me happy. “Mon Petit Chou” is a french term of endearment which translates directly to “My Little Cabbage” ( the French language never fails to amuse me). For those of you who know me, it is a pun on both my name and my size. Eating views: I am an omnivore but I try to cook vegetarian when I can.</p>
