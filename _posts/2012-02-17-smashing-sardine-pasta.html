<p>Some days should come with a caution label-- warning: need for extra caffeine.<br />
Today was one of those days: problem sets and coding until 5:30 am, work from 10-1, class from 1-6, scrambling to finish homework in lecture.<br />
Days like this, food is no small comfort: a warm and hearty dinner can make all the difference in the world!<br />
Enter this speedy pasta dish, made up on the fly with leftovers in the fridge and an oft-overlooked (but incredibly nourishing) pantry staple: sardines. Perfect brain food to get you through even the busiest of days!</p>
<p><strong>Smashing Sardine Pasta</strong><br />
<em>Serves 1 </em>(although it's always handy to double up on pasta for lunch the next day!)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 can sardines in tomato sauce (about 3-4 oz)</li>
<li>2 oz whole wheat spaghetti</li>
<li>2 c fresh spinach</li>
<li>1 T olive oil</li>
<li>1 T fresh lemon juice (1/2 lemon)</li>
<li>generous amount of fresh ground pepper!</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In a small pot, bring water to a rolling boil. Cook spaghetti according to box directions until al dente. Drain and coat with olive oil.</li>
<li>In the same pot, steam spinach with a bit of water until soft and wilted. Toss with spaghetti, and drizzle with ample lemon juice and fresh black pepper (be generous here--it really brightens up the dish!).</li>
<li>Top with sardines and sauce.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank goodness it's Thursday! College can be like bootcamp sometimes, but I'll be forever grateful for 3-day weekends.</p>
