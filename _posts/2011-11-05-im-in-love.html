<p>with my new iPhone.<br />
love.<br />
love.<br />
love like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://pusheen.tumblr.com/"><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_llbam0IVkW1qhy6c9o1_400.gif" alt="" width="350" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>I have a habit of falling in love with things that are not boys.<br />
Or people, for that matter.<br />
But that is another point.</p>
<p>It's a love that leaves my half-done discrete math problem set in a heap on the kitchen table.<br />
A love that leaves my trusty steed, the good old Canon, crying in the drawer.<br />
A love that makes an extreme bookworm put down her reading.<br />
Now that's saying a lot.</p>
<p>To be fair, it wasn't the only reason I missed out on Fashion Friday yesterday--it's Fall Break (finally! I've had it up to my ears with schoolwork) for Columbia, and the line at Port Authority turned out to be ridiculously delayed, so by the time I got home, I was in no state for a photo shoot.</p>
<p>Will you take a cookie as an apology?</p>

<p>Do not be fooled by their "healthy" facade.</p>
<p>They may be vegan and butterless, but these cookies are ADDICTIVE.<br />
The fact that they're loaded with chocolate chips may or may not help.</p>
<p>Chewy, moist, soft and full of pumpkin flavor, it's like pumpkin pie in a cookie. With chocolate. Perfect for the holidays, which (I can hardly believe) are coming up! And try to restrain yourself from devouring all the raw batter, which tastes exactly like pumpkin pie. In cookie dough form. 'Nuff said. Can you tell I'm in love?</p>
