<p>This cake couldn’t be simpler to make and tastes simply divine! Perfect for the fall season, especially holiday gatherings (Rosh Hashanah, Thanksgiving). With no butter, it also makes a great breakfast :) The hardest step is waiting for it to bake!</p>
<p>Note: This is ⅓ the size of the original recipe, perfect for a family of four (make a larger one for a gathering, and add 10-20 min. baking time).</p>
<p>Apple Sharlotka<br />
Adapted from <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/01/apple-sharlotka/">Smitten Kitchen</a><br />
Makes a small cake, serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>2 medium apples (I used golden delicious)</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1/3 c sugar</li>
<li>1/3 t vanilla</li>
<li>1/3 c flour</li>
<li>butter, for greasing</li>
</ul>
<p>1. This couldn’t be simpler. First, preheat oven to 350F and thoroughly butter a small round cake pan (I used a four-cup pyrex glass dish).<br />
2. Peel and core the apples. Then, slice it into small chunks: I cut each apple into quarters, then made thin slices. Put the apples in the bottom of the pan.<br />
3. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg. Add sugar and vanilla; beat till thick and smooth. Beat in the flour, gradually.<br />
4. Pour batter over apples, and press it into the nooks and crannies. You don’t really need to mix it in, just make sure it’s not all floating at the top.<br />
5. Bake for about 50 min, or until the top is golden brown, and a toothpick inserted comes clean.<br />
6. Serve warm or cooled, dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon.</p>
