<p>Hello, old friend-- long time, no see! I promise I'll get back to writing to you more soon. But for now, a recipe-- both salty &amp; sweet, just like my feelings about leaving my Alma Mater.</p>
<p><em>Salted Caramel Brownies</em><br />
Makes 1 8" pan, cut into 16 squares (they're very rich!)</p>
<p>Fudge brownies are pretty much perfect as is but the addition of salted caramel makes them heavenly. My suitemates have been clamoring for the recipe for a week now, so I caved and am back to blogging. These are especially good chilled-- really like candy, almost.</p>
<p>Mark Bittman is one of my favorite chefs and his formula for brownies is my go-to-recipe: so simple it's child-proof, fudgy and sweet with crackly tops. I also love that they don't use cocoa powder, which I never seem to have lying around.</p>
<p>Nota bene: best friend's mother, who is an amazing cook, made this huge bowl of homemade dulce de leche-- pretty much the most addictive substance on earth. If you don't have such luck in friends, and are short on time, you can buy it premade-- or make it yourself.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, plus a little more for greasing the pan<br />
3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped<br />
1 cup sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br />
salt<br />
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional</p>
<p>about 1 cup dulce de leche, or however much 1 12-oz can of sweetened condensed milk makes</p>
<p>1. Heat the oven to 350°F. These are sticky, so either line the pan with aluminium foil and grease it or nonstick parchment paper (or else serving will be a nightmare!).</p>
<p>2. Combine the stick of butter and the chocolate in a small saucepan over very low heat, stirring occasionally. (Or microwave them in a large microwave-safe bowl on medium for 10-second intervals, stirring after each.) When the chocolate is just about melted, remove the saucepan from the heat (or bowl from the microwave) and continue to stir until the mixture is smooth.</p>
<p>3. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl (or use the bowl you put in the microwave) and stir in the sugar. Then beat in the eggs, one at a time. Gently stir in the flour, salt, and the vanilla if you’re using it.</p>
<p>4.Spread half the batter into the prepared pan. Carefully pour caramel over the top and gently spread with a spatula. Sprinkle with sea salt, then gently pour the rest of the batter over the top. Sprinkle again with a bit of sea salt over the top.</p>
<p>5. Bake 35-40 min, or until center is set (these take a lot longer than regular brownies but don't let them burn!).</p>
<p>This is the hard part-- cool for a good long time so that they're firm enough to cut. When brownies are cool, lift them out of the pan by the foil or parchment, place the whole thing on a cutting board, and cut into squares with a serrated knife, dipping in between cuts in hot water (they're super sticky, no joke!).</p>
<p>Enjoy :)</p>
