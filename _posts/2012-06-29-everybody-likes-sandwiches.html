<p>Long time no blog, I know, I know.<br />
The truth is I've been beyond mad busy with work, and enjoying summertime in the city.<br />
But the real excuse is that a full time job + tutoring on the side + fast food too often + not enough rest = not the best appetite. And if you know anything about me, it's that I can never say no to doing something fun or good food. Unfortunately, that's wreaking havoc on my health.</p>
<p>I'm trying to take things a bit easier and hopefully the food adventures will restart.<br />
On a less depressing note, I've been trying to amp-up the home-cooking (eating out every meal just can't be good!) and here's one tasty result:</p>

<p>Sauteed zucchini + Sabra hummus on a fresh, delicious, seed-y roll from Whole Foods.<br />
New best homemade sandwich ever!</p>

<p>I really am a firm believer in the school of thought that the bread makes the sandwich, and this roll was superb!</p>
