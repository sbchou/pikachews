<p>There is a common stereotype that stereotypes are bad.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like I spend a lot of my day and a lot of my life fighting against them.</p>
<p>Plant-lover, but not a tree-hugger.</p>
<p>City girl, small town roots.</p>
<p>Cupcake-making, kitten-obsessed feminist.</p>
<p>Bookworm, writer, engineer. (For the record SEAS can read!*)</p>
<p>Sometimes, it can get rather tiring.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you're not sure whether to be pleased you've fooled them so well or punch the next person in the face who exclaims: "You're an engineer? I thought you were an English major!" Read: because you're a girl and you don't have four-inch glasses. No way!</p>
<p>But just between you and me, stereotypes exist for a reason. Sometimes they're kind of true. Sometimes I even endorse them.</p>

<p>Hello my name is small Asian girl, and Hello Kitty makes me happy. Especially in cookie form. Bonus points for pink-ness and tiny-ness. Kthxbai.</p>

<p>Cookie recipe adapted from <a href="http://bakingbites.com/2005/10/lime-curd-thumbprint-cookies/ http://www.wikicu.com/SEAS">Baking Bites</a><br />
*<a href="http://www.wikicu.com/SEAS">SEAS = School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. </a>"SEAS can't read" is a joke I've heard floating around campus. It infuriates me to no end.</p>
