<p>A little sloppy, yes, but i'm pretty please with how it turned out since i only had an hour to decorate. The cake itself is the cappuccino cupcake recipe from VCTOTW made in a loaf pan. I frosted it with cocoa "butter"cream frosting. I wasn't entirely happy with the frosting-- it was a bit melty and not very smooth-- maybe because i used earth balance tub margarine?</p>
