<p style="text-align: center;">It's not Friday, I know.<br />
But...<br />
It's been a really crazy week.<br />
And my photographer friend has been sick.<br />
And basically...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ks2h3iNl0k1qzcgh0o1_500.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_ks2h3iNl0k1qzcgh0o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="456" height="342" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just kidding!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Anyway, to make up for my tardiness, here are not just one, but TWO outfits.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The first is my lovely roommate Caroline's:</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="375" caption="no citations, sorry, unless I rummage through her closet...which may not turn out so well"]<a title="mod dots by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6269947990/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6269947990_d22e890f8c.jpg" alt="mod dots" width="375" height="500" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It's very indicative of her style: cute but classy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And here's mine:</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="318" caption="top (dress), american apparel; jeggings, forever 21; heels, thrifted"]<a title="15-way dress, as a shirt by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6269938874/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6269938874_d7ffa1a2d7.jpg" alt="15-way dress, as a shirt" width="318" height="500" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This outfit is composed of three of my favorite items of clothing: jeggings (because why wear pants when you can wear spandex??), the satiny, Italian-made red pumps I got for twenty (TWENTY!) dollars at Housing Works thrift shop this summer, and theÂ <a href="http://store.americanapparel.net/rsa8339.html?cid=726">absolutely amazing infinity bandeau dress from American Apparel</a>. I swear that dress is magic--you can wear it 15+ ways, even as a top, like I did here! And black never goes out of style. I'm thinking about getting <a href="http://store.americanapparel.net/rsa8342.html?cid=29">the pencil version</a>, too, for a going-out LBD! Christmas, maybe?</p>
