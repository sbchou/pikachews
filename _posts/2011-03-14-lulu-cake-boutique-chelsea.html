<p>I’m a firm believer that the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2227216/">cupcake trend</a> is not a trend. Sure, <a href="http://www.vanillagarlic.com/2007/05/maple-bacon-cupcakes-with-maple.html">bacon cupcakes</a> may be pushing it, but the good-old chocolate on vanilla has been a bake sale staple for decades and will likely continue to be, regardless of economic boom-and-bust, even when the craze for gourmet flavors dies down.</p>
<p>Anyway, a nice side effect of this recent cupcake revival is that NYC has literally become a cupcake Mecca, with bakeries in every borough claiming to make the best buttercream and tenderest vanilla. Unfortunately, as an avid cupcake baker (and a little bit of a snob) myself, I’ve found these claims mostly ungrounded; all too often, innocent little treats are replaced by gargantuan blobs of sugary frosting and coarse cake (i’m talking to you, <a href="http://www.crumbs.com/">Crumbs</a>).</p>
<p>To me, cupcakes should be light yet satisfying; sweet, but not overly so, with just the right ratio of frosting-to-cake.<br />
Fortunately, <a href="http://www.everythinglulu.com/">Lulu’s Cake Boutique</a> fulfilled all my criteria, and then some. </p>
<p><a title="Raspberry Rhapsody Cupcake, Lulu Cake Boutique by monpetitchoufleur, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47433192@N02/5527916438/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5527916438_a0026d2391.jpg" alt="Raspberry Rhapsody Cupcake, Lulu Cake Boutique" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The Raspberry Rhapsody cupcake I ordered was absolutely delicious, perhaps the best cupcake I’ve had in Manhattan so far. The vanilla cake was moist and fine-textured, the raspberry buttercream smooth and light, and the lemon curd filling fresh and tangy. The frosting-filling-cake ratio was spot-on; and the cupcake itself the perfect size—a real cupcake size, like the kind you bake at home, no more, no less. At $2.75 the cupcakes may cost more than your homemade treats, but are on par with most prices in NYC, the same as a chocolate or vanilla <a href="http://www.magnoliabakery.com/home.php">Magnolia</a> cupcake. But where <a href="http://www.magnoliabakery.com/home.php">Magnolia’s</a> goes for that homemade feel, with the imperfections in the cake and rustic frosting adding to its appeal, these cupcakes are all class.</p>
