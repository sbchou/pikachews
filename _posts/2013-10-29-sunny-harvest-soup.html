<p>After a long cold day, I wanted to make a soup that reminded me of Thanksgiving and comfort-- minus all the hours of preparation and food coma from overly rich dishes. How could I capture the essence of the holidays using what little frugal and vegetarian ingredients I had?</p>
<p>Food is steeped in tradition and family, but it is also a science, and psychological one: satisfying our cravings often have to more with our attachment to certain special flavors and textures rather than the entire dish.</p>
<p>Holiday dinners always seem to be centered around some sort of roasted bird-- be it turkey or chicken, and surrounded by winter vegetables (roots and squashes). But it’s not really about the fowl: after all, we might eat sliced turkey in our subs and begrudgingly cold chicken for supper.</p>
<p>More important are the spices: things like sage, thyme, and dill, and the textures: warm, soft, tender.</p>
<p>These are the senses I tried to mimic. Using the three Sisters we learned about in kindergarten (sweet corn, hearty beans, and squash cooked till it melts in your mouth), plenty of thyme and dill (common bird roasting spices), and tiny sweet onions, plus an umami kick from soy sauce, I think it nails comfort on the head.</p>
<p><strong>Sunny Harvest Stew</strong><br />
<em>Feeds 4 normal eaters or 2 Sophies<br />
Cook time: about an hour</em></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>¼ butternut squash</li>
<li>½ can sweet corn (I love Trader Joe’s!)</li>
<li>½ can white beans</li>
<li>1 cup frozen (or fresh) pearl onions (from Trader Joe’s as well)</li>
<li>4 cups water</li>
<li>1 tsp thyme</li>
<li>½ tsp dill</li>
<li>2 splashes soy sauce</li>
<li>salt, pepper</li>
<li>T olive oil</li>
<li>½ c orzo</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Put the onions in a large pot with a splash of water some soy sauce. Cook over medium heat till soft.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, chop the squash into 1-inch chunks. Add this to the pot, along with all remaining ingredients except for orzo.</li>
<li>Stew, covered, for about 30-40 min, or until everything’s nice and soft, and then stir in orzo.</li>
<li>Cook for 8-10 minutes more, until orzo is al dente and some of the stock is absorbed.</li>
<li>Serve with freshly ground pepper.</li>
</ol>
