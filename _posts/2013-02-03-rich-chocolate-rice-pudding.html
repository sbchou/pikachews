<p>If there's one dessert that you should learn to make from scratch I'd argue it's this: rice pudding. Not chocolate cake, mousse, or even bananas flambe. There's nothing more homey and comforting than stirring up a bowl of creamy pudding on a quiet Sunday afternoon, and unlike a good layer cake, which you can arguably order from a reputable neighborhood bakery, storebought rice pudding is not even in a comparable galaxy of taste as homemade. No gelatin or other weird animal by-products, fresh milk, and you can enjoy it warm!</p>
<p>Like sushi, the key to a top-notch pudding lies in the quality of rice (which I have concluded after traveling to Tokyo and marveling at the rolls there). Actually, I in fact did use sushi rice, which in my Asian opinion is the Best Rice (I use it for risotto, too!). Since there are so few ingredients-- just rice, milk, sugar, salt, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla-- be sure to use fresh milk and quality chocolate, too. Each flavor stands out.</p>
<p>The result is a super rich and creamy rice pudding, far more delicious than anything you can get in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. For an amazing traditional pudding, omit chocolate chips. Enjoy chilled, or warm--perfect for a late winter's day.</p>
<p><em>Rich Chocolate Rice Pudding</em><br />
adapted from the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sandra-lee/chocolate-rice-pudding-recipe/index.html">Food Network</a><br />
Yield: 4 servings, ~4 cups</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
*2/3 c sushi rice<br />
*3 c fresh whole milk<br />
*1/2 c sugar (may reduce to 1/3 c)<br />
*pinch salt<br />
*1/2 t cinnamon<br />
*1 t vanilla<br />
*1/2 c dark chocolate chips</p>
<p>Directions:<br />
1. In a medium pot, bring 1 1/3 cups water to a boil. Add the rice, cover and turn the heat to low. Cook until all the water has been absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes.<br />
2. To the pot with the rice, stir in the milk, sugar and salt. Bring to a simmer, turn the heat to low and cook until the mixture is thickened, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and scorching.<br />
3. Remove from the heat, stir in the chocolate chips and vanilla and let rest for 5 min<br />
utes. Serve warm or cover and cool in refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</p>
