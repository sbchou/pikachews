<p style="text-align: center;">The weather continues its mood swings here in the Big Apple, oscillating from summer to fall, from sunny blue skies to stormy downpour all within the span of an hour. It was mild enough today to wear shorts, well, at least for a little bit (it's currently pouring and way chilly outside), and I did not that let that opportunity go missed (does anyone else find women's jeans/pants in general so constricting? I adore shorts weather and attempt to extend the season as long as I can, although I may have to admit defeat soon). As always, photo creds to the lovely <a href="http://blog.amritamaz.me/">Amrita Maz</a>!</p>
