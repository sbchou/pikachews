<p style="text-align: left;">I can hardly believe it's only two days until Christmas!<br />
With the stress of exams and school making the days a caffeinated blur, and the unusually sadly warm weather, it hardly seems like late December.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Holidays are not big deals at our house, but still, there's something exciting about all the anticipation. And of course, it's an excuse to bake dozens and dozens of cookies!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aren't these reindeer cookies just adorable? I used the same peanut butter cookie recipe as for the <a href="http://www.mpetitchou.com/2011/stressed-is-desserts-spelled-backwards/">Peanut Butter Nutella Thumbprints</a>, and it turned out great!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Little Reindeer Cookies</em><br />
Makes about 15 cookies</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 c AP flour</li>
<li>½ t baking soda</li>
<li>½ t salt</li>
<li>½ c pb</li>
<li>½ c honey</li>
<li>⅙ c oil</li>
<li>1 t vanilla</li>
<li>1 bag mini pretzel twists, broken into halves</li>
<li>1 bag m&amp;ms</li>
<li>mini chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 cookie sheets.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, stir together pb, honey, oil, and vanilla until creamy. Stir in dry ingredients until combined.</li>
<li>Roll tbs of dough into balls and place on baking sheets.</li>
<li>Stick two pretzel halves into each dough ball for “antlers”.</li>
<li>Bake for approximately 10 min, and immediately press an m&amp;m into the center of each cookie for the nose, and 2 mini chocolate chips for eyes.</li>
<li>Cool completely before serving!</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy Holidays from Mon Petit Chou!</p>
<p>P.S. Now that I'm on break, home and full of mom's cooking, expect more posts coming up :)</p>
