How is it possible to have so many hipsters per square foot? Where did they all come from? What the heck is Williamsburg?</p>
<p>These are the questions I ask myself as I sit here sipping my iced coffee, munching on a strawberry cream cheese carrot muffin, and mooching off free wifi on this hot hot day. My blouse, pearl earrings and sensible work flats stick out like a sore thumb amidst this tattooed, bespectacled, granny-dress-wearing crowd. Will I succumb to the plethora of vintage stores? Will I start drinking kombucha and eating gluten free pizza? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>But for now, we will always have coffee, and goddam, is Williamsburg full of great cafes.</p>
<p>THE LOW DOWN:</p>
<p><em>Variety Cafe</em></p>
<p>368 Graham Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211</p>
<p>Pros: Stumptown beans, plenty of outlets, free wifi</p>
<p>Odds of getting a table: high, compared to manhattan; low, compared to suburbia</p>
<p>Taste test: I had a regular iced coffee and poured in a little whole milk. Flavor was rich, nutty and delicious. Yay Stumptown! Bonus for muffin selection.</p>
<p>Recommended: yes!</p>
