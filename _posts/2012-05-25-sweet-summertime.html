<p><a title="hello NYU by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7264680656/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7264680656_67eb10ce57.jpg" alt="hello NYU" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Long time no blog, I know, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It seems like the last load of laundry from school was scarce dry before I was packing up my bags once again and trucking my suitcases back and self back to the City--this time, in the heart of things, right next to Union Square.</p>
<p>This lucky piece of prime real estate was landed for the summer with no small thanks to <a href="http://hackny.org">a great fellowship organization</a> that I am proud to call myself a member of. <a href="http://hackny.org/a/">hackNY</a>, which is now in its 3rd year, seeks to foster a community of young "hackers" and entrepreneurs by providing sponsored housing and a full-time internship at a start-up in New York City to top students/hackers around the nation. Although it is a fun and exciting opportunity, it also leaves little time for baking and blogging!</p>
<p>Here's my best effort to makeup for lost blogging time by a quick photo recap:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="hello NYU by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7264680866/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7264680866_f81aeca94a.jpg" alt="hello NYU" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>a little friend on the windowsill</em></p>
<p><a title="kayaking on the Hudson by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7264682058/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7264682058_557188fbe2.jpg" alt="kayaking on the Hudson" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>a beautiful day at Riverside Park </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(although it's been raining now for a week straight!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="kayaking on the Hudson by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7264682830/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7264682830_9a6f247a55.jpg" alt="kayaking on the Hudson" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>did you know there's free kayaking on the Hudson?! Yes yes.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="mac &amp; cheese, Giorgio's of Gramercy by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7264684734/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7264684734_cb520eca11.jpg" alt="mac &amp; cheese, Giorgio's of Gramercy" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Super rich mac &amp; cheese from <a href="http://www.giorgiosofgramercy.com/">Giorgio's of Gramercy</a> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(but not fiscally thanks to Groupon!)</em></p>
<p><a title="smore's bread pudding, Giorgio's of Gramercy by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7264685912/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7264685912_cac78dda0f.jpg" alt="smore's bread pudding, Giorgio's of Gramercy" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The most fudgy, chocolatey Smores' Bread Pudding! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The little balls are chocolate spots!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thank goodness it's Friday tomorrow! Forty-hour workweeks are quite a physical strain after the more fluid schedule of university life. Happy upcoming Memorial Day weekend!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nota Bene: I've been ruminating for a while now about starting another (more serious) blog for musings and opinions. I have a feeling that mixing food and politics and/or social critiques may lead to a bad appetite for all involved, so it would be a separate entity. Thoughts/suggestions?</p>
