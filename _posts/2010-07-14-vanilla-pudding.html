<p>This pudding is the shit.</p>
<p>I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been eating Kozy Shack rice pudding cups almost everyday since summer started, and those are full of eggs and milk and other good artery-clogging stuff. This pudding, on the other hand, is egg-free, and can easily be vegan if you wish.</p>
<p>It’s a soft, silky pudding (not as thick as some egg-based ones). I swear it tastes like vanilla bean ice cream. I bet it would make a good pudding pop.</p>
<p>Sorry for the lack of photos, but I ate it all…</p>
<p><em>Vanilla Pudding</em></p>
<p>makes 4 servings</p>
<p>recipe adapted from about.com</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
<li>3 tbsp cornstarch</li>
<li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
<li>2 cups whole or soy milk</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a large saucepan. Gradually blend in the soy milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</p>
<p>Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly until thickened. Cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, stirring now and then.</p>
<p>Remove the pudding from the heat and add the vanilla. Let cool for ten minutes, stirring now and then. Pour the pudding into a large serving dish or individual serving dishes and chill until firm, about 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
