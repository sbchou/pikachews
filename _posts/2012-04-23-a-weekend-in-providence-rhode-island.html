<p>My childhood friend &amp; cousin Alice is graduating from Brown University at the end of next month...It is sometimes frightening how fast time passes, seems like just yesterday we were playing Super Smash Bros. in her living room (then again, we may have done that last year). I spent the weekend in Providence, to make sure I would visit her Alma Mater at least once before she left!</p>
<p>Providence is quite a pretty little town and although not New York has some quality food!</p>
<p>First up: <a href="http://www.kabobandcurry.com/">Kabob &amp; Curry</a><br />
There aren't many decent Indian restaurants that I know of in Morningside Heights, so this was the perfect opportunity to indulge!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And indulge we did...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Kabob &amp; Curry, Providence RI by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7104733953/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7104733953_df3e7abb10.jpg" alt="Kabob &amp; Curry, Providence RI" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>we ordered crispy fried Vegetable Samosas and paper-thin Papadum to start, with a plethora of dipping sauces &amp; chutneys, then for entrees, the famous Chicken Tikki Marsala and Palak Paneer (my favorite!) with plenty of fresh Naan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Kabob &amp; Curry, Providence RI by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6958704966/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6958704966_476d219e0b.jpg" alt="Kabob &amp; Curry, Providence RI" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">to wash it all down: thick Mango Lassi!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And all of this came up to a mere $22 per person, with tip and tax. Sweet!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7104735563/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7104735563_2f9c4f3797.jpg" alt="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The next morning we stumbled down to <a href="http://www.louisrestaurant.org/">Louis Restaurant</a> around noon for a late breakfast/brunch. Truly a mom-&amp;-pop dive-y place, this little diner was featured on the Food Network show Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Z8z6-F7vs">check out the clip!</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6958667236/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6958667236_1edbd13c23.jpg" alt="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Since the place is quite small, we had to wait a bit for our table. Outside, they were selling baskets of fresh fruit (bananas and mangoes) for $1. Yum!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7104735909/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7104735909_23e3e035e2.jpg" alt="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Their fruit cup is truly the most pretty fruit cup I have ever encountered.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7104736169/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7104736169_415d4a7f3f.jpg" alt="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I ordered the Granola Pancakes (as featured in Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives!) topped with fresh fruit, and a nice milky glass of iced coffee. When I saw the fruit cup, I was worried that fruit-topped pancakes could not live up to it. Thankfully, my fears were unnecessary! These had to be the most gloriously fruit-topped pancakes I had ever seen. No watery frozen-thawed wimpy blueberries for Louis!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7104733699/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7104733699_259a7332a7.jpg" alt="Louis Restaurant, Providence RI" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">All around the diner, the walls were decorated with the most interesting photos, fan letters, and tchotchkes.</p>
