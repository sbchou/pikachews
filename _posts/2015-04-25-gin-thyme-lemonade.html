<p>After months and months of ever-ending snowfall disintegrating into slush the color of dirty tennis sneakers, plus risking getting sucked into unnerving wind tunnels on every corner turn, it seems like Spring has finally landed in Boston!</p>
<p>There's no time like Winter time to sip on my favorite drink-- the Manhattan-- and brood, but warmer weather calls for lighter (and more inventive!) imbibing. I'm trying to explore gin-based drinks, and this is a perfectly lemony, floral start. To be fair, I did try substituting bourbon in the base, but gin is the way to go: the pine-y flavor melds perfectly with thyme.</p>

<p><i>Gin Thyme Lemonade</i></p>
<p><i>For the thyme &amp; honey simple syrup:</i></p>
<p>- 1 cup sugar</p>
<p>- 3 large spoonfuls wildflower honey</p>
<p>- 2 cups water</p>
<p>- 3-4 sprigs of fresh thyme</p>
<p>In a small pot, combine all ingredients, and simmer over low heat for 5 minutes, constantly stirring so that the sugar dissolves evenly. Cool before using and store in a tightly covered container in the refridgerator. This recipe yields about 12 oz of simple syrup-- great for a crowd or future drinks. You can easily halve the recipe (just have a ratio of approx 1 sugar : 2 parts water), substitute all honey for sugar or vice versa, or even maple syrup!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>For the cocktails:</i></p>
<p><i>- </i>honey-thyme simple syrup, recipe above</p>
<p>- fresh lemon, juiced</p>
<p>- cold gin</p>
<p>- seltzer water, to taste</p>
<p>- large ice cubes</p>
<p>- ribbons of lemon peel, from the very well-washed lemon above</p>
<p>- fresh thyme</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cocktail is based off a <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/forgotten-gin-cocktails-part-1-166935">gin sour</a>: a 1: 1: 2 ratio of syrup : lemon : gin.</p>
<p>In a highball glass, combine 1 part simple syrup, 1 part fresh lemon juice and 2 parts gin. Mix well and fill glass with ice. Top with seltzer and a strip of lemon peel and a sprig of thyme. Enjoy!</p>
