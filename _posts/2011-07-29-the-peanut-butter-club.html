<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So. I have a job.</p>
<p>Actually, this post is a little too late, because by the time you read it, i'll probably be well into my last day.</p>
<p>No, I didn't get fired in record time; I've actually been interning since May, but like the boxes that remain stacked in the basement since I packed them up in the last overnighter of the semester (apparently I have enough shoes to fill a cardboard crate + 2 large tote bags? good to know!), my blogging to-do list seems to pile higher and higher, mostly gathering dust as well, hence the late introduction.</p>
<p>It's been a priceless experience. Although sitting at a desk for 40 hours a week (plus commuting 3 hours every day) took some time to get used to (up until then, my idea of work was comprised of a) sweating my ass off at a dance studio being yelled at by some angry lady in a Russian accent, or b) spending hours cross-legged in sweats and glasses alternating between cramming physics into my brain and Starbucks doubleshots into my mouth to make up for all those times I choose sleep over lecture (and no, I don't regret any of them)), <a href="http://www.omgpop.com/">OMGPOP</a> has one of the friendliest company cultures that i've encountered. Although I did not have the chance to do any technical work*, getting to know an incredibly talented (and funny) team was definitely the best part and made it all worthwhile, and then some. Plus, when else do you get to play games during work?</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention that Soho is a restaurant mecca?<br />
And that I got to try out a new place every Thursday, thanks to an awesome company-bonding event?</p>
<p>But sometimes, the most fun and delicious lunches were created right in the office.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I present the Peanut Butter Club!<br />
(This week's theme was Fruity Mexican. Whether that is a reference to a person or the tortillas we used to fill up with pb, chocolate, and all sorts of berries, I'll let you decide.)</p>

<p>Goodbye OMGPOP! Goodbye (for now), New York! I will be back to visit, surely.</p>
<p>*Speaking of which, summer job number 2 starts on Monday, and it involves writing computer programs to sort data from the web. So it is technical indeed. It also sounds a little scary, but, like Nike said, Just Do Itâ„¢.</p>
<p>P.S.: I'm breaking my golden rule of never posting photos of people, this is how much I love you, OMGPOP.</p>
