<p>Hello friends &amp; lovers,</p>
<p>It has been an absolutely incredible nearly 4 (!) years eating, cooking, and blogging at Mon Petit Chou. Unfortunately, like all good things, it cannot exist in the same form forever.</p>
<p><em>Therefore it is with a sad heart that I announce that Mon Petit Chou, the food blog, will be on hiatus for indeterminate amount of time; potentially for good.</em> Because I will be (as always) eating and cooking, I have started a much more streamlined tumblog, Pika Chews, at <a href="http://pika-choux.tumblr.com/">pika-choux.tumblr.com</a>. The idea is more posts, more pictures, less text. Please follow me!</p>
<p>In the meantime all the archived recipes will continue to exist on the old site and URL.</p>
<p>Here's to good memories and new beginnings,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>
