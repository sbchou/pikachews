<p style="text-align: center;">Hello, Cookie.<br />
You are very delicious indeed, albeit a tad unphotogenic.<br />
Sweet. Sassy. And a little bit nutty. Coco-nutty, that is.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="toasted coconut chocolate chip cookies by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7128669005/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7128669005_9260328f27.jpg" alt="toasted coconut chocolate chip cookies" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the first time I've ever put coconut in cookies, but it will most definitely not be the last! These cookies par excellence: crispy on the outside, sweet &amp; chewy on the inside, and full of chocolate. I was in a rush but I was still able to get them made from start to finish in 30 minutes. The original recipe called for chocolate chunks but I only had mini chips which resulted in a smattering of chocolate in every bite!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bonus: since the original recipe was from Cooking Light, you only need a bit (4 tablespoons) of butter!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em> Toasted Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">Makes 18 cookies (original yield 15, but I got 18 nice-sized cookies!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">Adapted from <a href="http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/toasted-coconut-chocolate-chunk-cookies/">Two Peas and their Pod</a> (changes in parentheses)</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>1 cup flaked sweetened coconut (unsweetened organic flaked coconut)</li>
<li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon coconut extract (omitted)</li>
<li>1 large egg (extra large)</li>
<li>3/4 cup chopped semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate (mini chocolate chips)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;">Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Toast coconut: arrange coconut in a single layer on baking sheet. Bake for 5-7 minutes or until coconut is lightly toasted, stirring once. Be very careful as it will burn rapidly! Set coconut aside to cool.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Lightly grease or line another baking sheet and set aside.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Whisk together flour, baking powder, soda, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">In a large bowl, add brown sugar and butter. Beat until creamy and smooth. (Originally called for stand mixer, but a fork and lots of elbow grease does the job!)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Beat in vanilla and egg. Slowly stir in flour mixture, and mix just until combined.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Stir in toasted coconut and chocolate chunks.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet. Bake at 350° for 10 minutes or until bottoms of cookies just begin to brown. Remove from pan, and cool completely on wire racks.</li>
</ol>
