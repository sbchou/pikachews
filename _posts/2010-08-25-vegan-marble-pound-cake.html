<p>I’m pretty sure a recipe like this cements my image as a (faux) vegan and pretty much shuns me from the omnivorous world. After all, I’m taking the beloved pound cake, originally called such because it require a <em>pound</em> each of butter, sugar, and eggs, and making it with <em>tofu</em>, for heavens’ sake. Oh yeah, and it’s also whole wheat, since I was trying to clean out the last of the whole wheat pastry flour I got from Whole Foods more than a year ago. Somewhere, Paula Deen is turning in her grave. Except she’s not dead yet.</p>
<p><em>Vegan Marble Pound Cake</em></p>
<p>Serves 8</p>
<p>Adapted from 1000 Vegan Recipes</p>
<p><em>This is a dense, moist cake, delicious cake. I decided at the last moment to make it a marble cake by swirling in some chocolate and I’m very glad I did. The chocolate flavor really stands out and it looks beautiful when sliced. I cannot attest for authenticity since the last time I had pound cake I was probably still in elementary school and it came from Quick Chek in an Entenmann’s blue box. Also, I made mine 100% whole wheat, so naturally the cake is slightly nuttier and more crumbly. If you want to go traditional, use white flour and omit the chocolate. I should note that I made this cake last night and it’s half gone already.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>2 c AP flour*</li>
<li>1 c sugar</li>
<li>1 T baking powder</li>
<li>½ t salt</li>
<li>1 c drained soft tofu**</li>
<li>½ c soymilk</li>
<li>¼ c oil</li>
<li>2 t vanilla</li>
<li>2 oz unsweetened (or bittersweet) chocolate</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease an 8” loaf pan.</li>
<li>Melt chocolate and set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Blend tofu, soymilk, oil, and vanilla together until smooth. Pour into dry mixture and stir until just combined.</li>
<li>Remove about 1 cup of the batter and stir in the chocolate.</li>
<li>Alternately layer vanilla and chocolate batter in the loaf pan. Cut through a few times with a knife to create swirls.</li>
<li>Bake for 40-50 min. Cool before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>
<p>*like I said, I used whole wheat pastry flour</p>
<p>**I used about 2/3 of a box of Mori-Nu firm silken tofu, squashed into a measuring cup.</p>
