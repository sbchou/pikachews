<p>When I was growing up, for some reason or the other (creativity? laughs? the unbridled joy of childhood?), my sister and her friend used to always say "Swiss Chard and Rutebega" in a ridiculous, prentitious, quasi-British accent. I never figured out why it was these vegetables that were the source of many giggles, aside from their funny names, and for nearly two decades, I had never tasted either.</p>
<p>All that changed yesterday while waiting in the ridiculously long (seriously, comical) line at Trader Joe's. A bag of Kalediscope Chard caught my eye-- with those pretty colors and fresh green leaves, how could I say no?</p>
<p>I've never cooked chard before but I figured like all dark leafy greens sauteeing is the best way to go. A quick Google search determined that white wine pairs well, so I threw some in for good measure. The result: dinner for two in under 20 minutes! You could even make this for date night if you're classy like that. I myself avoid cooking for men for stereotypical reasons, but one could always make exceptions.</p>
<p><em>Dinner for Two: Mini Ravioli w/ Kaleidoscope Chard in White Wine Sauce </em></p>
<ul>
<li>1 T salted butter (I like cooking with the salted stuff but feel free to use unsalted and season to taste)</li>
<li>1 cups dry mini ravioli (Trader Joe's, find in the dried pasta section)</li>
<li>1 bag (6 cups?) prewashed and cut Kalediscope Chard (Trader Joe's)</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>1/2 cup white wine (&lt;= the quality of whatever you're drinking)</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Make pasta: bring a large pot of water to a boil, and pour in ravioli. Cook for 15-18 min, or until al-dente.<br />
2. MEANWHILE: Heat up a large frying pan over medium-high heat.<br />
3. Finely chop onion (and chard if not pre-cut). When pan is hot, throw in a pat of butter, and onions. Cook until onions are browned and wilted.<br />
4. Add Swiss Chard and pour in the wine. Cook over medium heat until leaves are tender and wine has evaporated.<br />
5. When pasta is ready, drain and add to frying pan. Toss with veggies and sauce, and serve.</p>
