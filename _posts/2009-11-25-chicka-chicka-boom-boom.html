<p>I recently got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Cookies-Invade-Your-Cookie/dp/160094048X">this lovely book</a> which turned out to be just as awesome as its counterpart, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Cupcakes-Take-Over-World/dp/1569242739/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1259179372&amp;sr=1-1">Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World</a> (and as cleverly named). This is the first recipe I’ve tried from it, although to be fair, I actually got the recipe online over a year ago from <a href="http://vegancupcakes.wordpress.com/2007/07/04/graham-crackers/#comments">the Vegan Cupcakes blog</a> (it can also be found <a href="http://theppk.com/blog/2007/07/04/graham-crackers/">here</a>). The graham crackers are great- sweet, but not too sweet, and crunchy without being hard. They might even be better than Trader Joe’s cinnamon Cats Cookies (for people).<br />
The original recipe calls for rolling the dough out into a square and cutting out graham cracker-like rectangles, but I felt it necessary to use a chicken-shaped cookie cutter. Either way, it’s your call, but if you must make rectangles, be forewarned that the recipe states the yield to be 12.</p>

<p><strong>Granimal Crackers </strong><strong>(slightly adapted from the “Graham Crackers” recipe in Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar)</strong></p>
<p><em>Makes about 30 cut-outs</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p>1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour<br />
1/3 cup sugar<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
1/4 cup oil<br />
2 tablespoons molasses<br />
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />
1/4 cup soy milk</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a light colored baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p>In a large bowl mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Make a well in the middle and pour in oil, molasses and vanilla. Give the liquid ingredients a quick wisk with a fork and then continue mixing until everything is well combined and crumbly.</p>
<p>Drizzle in the milk and combine. Use your hands to knead the dough a few times until it holds together, add an extra tablespoon of rice milk if needed. You should be able to form a pliable ball of dough.</p>
<p>Line a work surface with parchment. Place the dough on the parchment and use a rolling pin to roll approximately 1/8 in. thick, and cut shapes using a cookie cutter. Transfer to baking sheet. Repeat with scraps.</p>
<p>Bake for 12 to 14 minutes.</p>
<p>Let cool completely on the baking sheet.</p>
