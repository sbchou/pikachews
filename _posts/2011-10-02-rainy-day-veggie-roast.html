<p>It's one of those Saturdays: rainy, drowsy, chilly.<br />
A day to get up at noon, and spend the day holed up in the library (well, until you get kicked out for eating cookies. theoretically.). A day to try out that new drip coffee at <a href="http://www.joetheartofcoffee.com/">Joe's</a>. A day to make this super easy (literally throw into the oven and walk away!) and economical dinner. A perfect dinner to enjoy in rainy Saturday peace…Now if only the frat next door would refrain from blasting the dub step and shouting at the top of their lungs…</p>
<p><em>Rainy Day BBQ Tofu &amp; Veggie Roast</em><br />
Makes 3 hearty servings</p>
<p>• 1 block extra firm tofu, cubed<br />
• about ½ cup BBQ sauce<br />
• 2 large potatoes, cut into thick fries<br />
• large bunch of broccoli, floreted<br />
• salt, pepper, olive oil</p>
<p>1. Preheat oven to 400°F (see note). Grease two baking sheets.<br />
2. In separate bowls, toss broccoli &amp; potatoes with oil until well coated. Mix together tofu &amp; BBQ sauce in a third bowl.<br />
3. Put the veggies into one baking sheet, spreading them all out, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.<br />
4. Pour tofu onto another sheet.<br />
5. Bake for 20-30 min, or until tender and browned.<br />
6. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Note:<br />
The oven in my dorm kitchen is a little wonky and tends to underheat so I ended up roasting everything for about 30-40 min, and sadly, the veggies didn't get as crisp and caramelized as they ought to. Next time i'm upping it to 425° and seeing how it goes, but if you are on peaceful terms with your own oven, 400° for 20-30 min. should be just fine and dandy.</p>
<p>Adding it All Up:</p>
<p>• organic extra firm tofu: 2.49<br />
• 2 idaho potatoes: 1.26<br />
• large bunch of broccoli: 1.67<br />
• organic BBQ sauce (for the whole bottle): 2.99</p>
<p>For 3 meals (and not measly portions either!), the whole thing costs $8.41—which makes it just $2.80 per dinner. And that’s using partially organic ingredients, in one of the most expensive cities in the world. How’s that for budget cooking?</p>
