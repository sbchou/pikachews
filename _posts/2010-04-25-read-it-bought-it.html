<p>With all the required reading they throw at you in school, I almost forgot how deliciously addictive leisure reading can be. That is until I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Open-Autobiography-Andre-Agassi/dp/0307268195/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1272207010&amp;sr=8-1">Andre Agassi's biography</a>, <em>Open</em>, at the library yesterday. It's not the best autobiography/memoir I've ever read, but it is definitely captivating and especially interesting to me since I love watching the grand slams on tv and play a little tennis myself. I highly recommend taking a peek into this book if you want a look into the real, and devastatingly lonely, world of professional tennis.</p>

<p>On a side note, S and I went to the mall yesterday and discovered this cute little store, <a href="http://francescascollections.com/">Francesca’s Collections</a>, 10 minutes before closing time. (We have a habit of finding new stores just as we are about to leave.) It was adorable—reminiscent of <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/index.jsp">Anthropologie</a>, but everything was reasonably priced (although not dirt-cheap like forever 21), around $30 to $40. I couldn’t help but buy a folding strawberry bag from their piles of charming odds-and-ends. At only $3.50, this bag is fascinating and useful—it folds up into a little strawberry for easy storage!</p>
