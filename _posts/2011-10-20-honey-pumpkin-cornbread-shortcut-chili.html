<p>Halloween is coming up right around the corner, which means…it's officially pumpkin season!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's also the start of (never-ending) midterm season, which means that things can get quite haphazard, to say the least. To celebrate a rare calm between deadlines and exams, I stirred up this hearty (and healthy!) bean chili, a stick-to-your-ribs rainy-day meal (perfect for hungry college students!). To go with it, I adapted Lindsay's cornbread recipe from the Happy Herbivore Cookbook to make it pumpkin (of course!) and honey flavored. I was a little skeptical, since it was not only vegan but fat free, but it was absolutely heavenly! So moist and sweet. Definitely the best cornbread recipe I've ever made.</p>
<p>If you have Lindsay's book, the recipe for cornbread is on page 49. Just substitute pumpkin puree for the applesauce, and honey for the maple syrup, if you're not vegan. No need for extra sugar!</p>

<p>Look at that Smart Balance shmear, mmm...</p>

<p>P.S. Guess what came in the mail for me yesterday? A Hello Kitty Thermos! Yes, it's ridiculously pink, and yes, it cheers me up immensely. Can't wait to bring my chili in it to work :)</p>
