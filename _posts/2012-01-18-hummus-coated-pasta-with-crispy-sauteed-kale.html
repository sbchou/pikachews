<p style="text-align: left;">Sorry about the blog disappearance! Between vacation and packing and moving back in to school, not to mention internship applications and reunions with old friends, it’s been crazy busy around these parts. I promise to start posting regularly as soon as I get back into the swing of things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyways, enough talk! Here’s a quick (took me only about 15 min from start to finish!), healthy, and comforting meal, perfect for the first day of classes in a brand new semester. Enjoy!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Hummus-coated Pasta with Crispy Sautéed Kale</em><br />
makes 2 servings (one for dinner, one for lunch tomorrow!)</p>
<ul>
<li>about 2 cups of kale, chopped into bite-size pieces (I used about half a prewashed bag from my favorite grocery, Trader Joe’s!)</li>
<li>about 1 T olive oil</li>
<li>about 4oz whole wheat spaghetti (enough for 2 people)</li>
<li>¼ cup hummus (I used original, but I bet flavored ones would be great! Sundried tomato, garlic, mmm....)</li>
<li>2-3 tbs water</li>
<li>fresh lemon, optional</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Set a medium saucepan full of water over high heat. When the water boils, stir in the spaghetti.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat until very hot.</li>
<li>Add oil, tilting to cover the bottom of the pan, then toss in kale, stirring quickly to coat and prevent from burning.</li>
<li>Decrease heat to medium, stirring frequently, until kale starts to crisp and brown.</li>
<li>If the kale is not cooking evenly, cover and let steam for a bit, giving it a stir every so often. Be careful not to let it burn--decrease heat if necessary!</li>
<li>Sprinkle with salt &amp; pepper and set aside.</li>
<li>When pasta is ready, drain, and stir in the hummus, adding enough water to thin it out into a thick sauce.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and add a healthy squeeze of lemon, if using.</li>
<li>Serve warm or cold, topped with crispy kale!</li>
</ol>

<p>Kale is one of my absolute favorite winter veggies--if you haven't tried it, you're missing out! <a href="http://www.mpetitchou.com/2011/black-bean-%E2%80%93stuffed-sweet-potatoes-with-kale-chips/">Kale chips </a>are another great way to enjoy them. All you busy bees out there: any other suggestions for quick &amp; easy pasta meals?</p>
