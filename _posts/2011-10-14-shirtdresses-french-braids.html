<p>This week my photographer/CS nerd bffl Amrita was not feeling too good, so this shot was taken on my little point-and-shoot camera by my lovely roommate Caroline.</p>
<p>Caroline is the one who wakes me up in the morning when my alarm's gone off for the 90th time, and also gently (or not so gently) reminds me to stop wearing my favorite black leggings for the 3rd day in a row and put on some pants. She's actually one of the motivations behind Fashion Friday. She also happens to be great at doing hair, and so the french braid I'm sporting is courtesy of her.</p>
<p>For 30 Rock fans out there, this pretty much sums up our relationship:</p>

<p>As a side note, I used a vintage filter on this photo. Not sure if I like the color effects 100%? I'm still trying to get a hang of photo editing.</p>
