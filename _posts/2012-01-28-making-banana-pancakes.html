<p>Nothing <del>smells</del> spells weekend like pancakes!<br />
Unlike this recipe for <a href="http://www.mpetitchou.com/2011/vegan-pumpkin-pancakes-for-one/">single-serving Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Pancakes</a>, (which are fluffy and delicious and pumpkin-y and chocolate-y but also makes a wee bit too much pancake for one petite person), these Choco-Banana recipe makes just 2 pancakes: perfect for a sweet breakfast treat: no more, no less.</p>
