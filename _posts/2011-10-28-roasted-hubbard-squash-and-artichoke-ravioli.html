<p>I got the funniest looking squash from the market the other day, isn't it such a bright &amp; cheery color? I couldn't help but buy it.</p>

<p>Turns out it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita_maxima">hubbard squash</a>. Cut it into hunks and roasted it slathered with olive oil and a smidge of salt and pepper. Not bad! It reminds me a bit of kabocha squash (my favorite!) in texture, but not as sweet. I absolutely adore all sorts of squash.</p>

<p>Served with some artichoke ravioli from Trader Joe's (another thing I absolutely adore), it was a delicious dinner to celebrate the end of the week!</p>
