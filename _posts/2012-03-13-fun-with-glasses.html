<p>Thank God for Tina Fey. She has, among other things, (such as being hilarious!) made the once-nerdy glasses "nerdy-chic". Still, whenever I'm bespectacled, I can't help but remember the old idiotic adage: "Girls with glasses don't get passes", which makes me want to punch myself twice, once for being superficial, and another time for being a bad feminist.</p>
<p>Anyways, I had a ball picking out these fun glasses at <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/">Zenni Optical</a>, where they were having a great "Buy 2 get 1 free" sort of deal. The total was only around $50 for 3 glasses which is a very, very good price. Overall I was quite pleased with my order although it was a bit slow--the quality is not bad for plastic frames, and the prescription feels good. The only thing is that their factories are located in China so that may lead to further ethical investigations especially since their prices are so low, but we will save that for another discussion.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Side note: I am proud to say these are the product of nerd power and hope to fuel some more nerdy projects (as anyone who is a Computer Scientist knows, programming with contacts in is a very bad idea)! The money I used to buy them was taken from a prize I won at the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/09/columbias-devfest-2012/">Columbia University DevFest</a> in the first week of January (well, the prize was a Kindle but I prefer my books on paper so I sold that on Craigslist).</p>
