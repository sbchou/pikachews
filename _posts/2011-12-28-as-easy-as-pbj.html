<p>Homemade gifts are always a welcome respite from the usual mass commercialization of the holiday season. Plus, more the motivation to experiment in the kitchen!</p>
<p>I'm almost embarrassed to post this recipe on my blog because it's just SO simple.<br />
It's a great gift for any Nutella or Reeses' fanatic (and who isn't? I happen to be both).<br />
I gave it to my dear friend in a Secret Santa exchange and she really enjoyed it!</p>

<p>STEP THREE:</p>
<p>Stir until chocolate is fully incorporated with the peanut butter (the heat of the pb will cause it to melt!) and spread is smooth and glossy.</p>
