<p>Living in New York is an absolute dream for a pastry aficionado like myself (among many other reasons!). There seems to be a new hot bakery springing up somewhere in Manhattan every week--an endless stream of cupcakes and ice cream and doughnuts and gelato to try. Not that I'm complaining, at all!</p>
<p>Last weekend my sister was in the city for the day, so we decided to scope out the Bouchon Bakery in the 3rd floor of the swanky Times Warner Center at Columbus Circle. Founded by the famous chef <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keller">Thomas Keller</a>, the chain of Bouchon Bakeries have drawn quite positive reviews so of course I had to try it for myself.</p>

<p>Here's our spread, which we enjoyed in Central Park, since (like everything else in New York!) there was very little sitting room next to the bakery storefront.</p>
<p><a title="chocolate tart, bouchon bakery by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6349069484/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6349069484_7f2c1f2c84.jpg" alt="chocolate tart, bouchon bakery" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>First off, a cute little chocolate tart. I have to say the presentation at Bouchon was quite lovely, as you can see with the little gold leaf and delicate placement of hazelnuts. But did the taste live up to its beautiful presentation? Unfortunately, the tart was good, but not fantastic-- the embedding of too-crunchy/hard whole cocoa nibs in the otherwise smooth filling and odd strands of sugar in the crust did not lead to such a pleasing taste experience. Simpler, and better chocolate tarts to be had elsewhere.</p>

<p>Having had pastries at the Laduree on les Champs-Elysees, I feel qualified to review any macaron that comes my way. These were very good for an American bakery--rather large (the size of one's palm!) but sufficiently moist, with good structure and a nice twist with the cranberry flavor and smooth filling.</p>

<p>Always a sucker for "fun foods", I couldn't help but give the chocolate "Ho-Ho" a go, an upscale rendition of <a href="http://www.hostesscakes.com/hohos.asp">the Hostess snack-cake.</a>Â It was good, but again, not mind blowing, chocolate sponge rolled up with chocolate mousse inside, enrobed in a layer of more chocolate.</p>
<p><a title="coffee, bouchon bakery by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6348317539/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6348317539_1d7644cb51.jpg" alt="coffee, bouchon bakery" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, being the caffeine addict that I am, I had a cup of coffee to wash it all down. The coffee was quite good, for a bakery.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pleasant sugar high for a Saturday afternoon.<br />
However, given the higher prices and lack of seating room/over-hype (like every other thing in the City!), I would prefer to take my afternoon coffee break in a cozier cafe, as the desserts were delicious, but nothing mind-blowing. Still, definitely worth trying!</p>
