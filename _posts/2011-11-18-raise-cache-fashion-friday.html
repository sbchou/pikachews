<p>Happy Friday!</p>
<p>In fashion related news, I had the greatest time yesterday volunteering at <a href="http://raisecache.com/">Cache</a>, a benefit fashion show for Hack NY, produced by the talented <a href="http://rebeccazhou.com/">Rebecca Zhou</a>. It was held in the 69th Regiment Armory, on Lexington Ave. So cool!</p>

<p>It was so fun to see artists, developers, and even CEOs of companies like <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>, Google, and <a href="http://www.aviary.com/">Aviary</a> strut their stuff, and it was great to catch up and bust some moves with my friends from OMGPOP.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="http://turntable.fm/lobby">Turntable</a> were dj-ing, and they had life-size cardboard cutouts of their avatars!</p>
<p>Anyway, here's my outfit for Fashion Friday, which is considerably less exciting (it was taken earlier this week).</p>
