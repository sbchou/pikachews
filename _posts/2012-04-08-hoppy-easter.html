<p>I first spied this adorable concept of a cupcake in, of course,<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/how-to/spring-chick-cakes"> Martha Stewart magazine</a>. (Although, now that I look at it, my chicks turned out a bit different in style, but no less cute, n'est-ce pas? Martha seemed to have iced the cupcake upside down for a nice tapered shape, that clever bastard.)</p>
<p>Anyhoo, this proved to be quite a fun &amp; uplifting Sunday afternoon project.<br />
Here's a rough sketch/recipe:</p>
<p><em>Baby Chick Cupcakes</em><br />
Makes 12<br />
Adapted from <em><a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/how-to/spring-chick-cakes">Martha Stewart Living</a></em></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 recipe for 1 dozen of your favorite vanilla cupcakes (you can use cake mix, too!)</li>
<li>1 can vanilla frosting (I used the "whipped" kind to make it nice and fluffy)</li>
<li>about 1/2 bag coconut, unsweetened</li>
<li>mini chocolate chips (24)</li>
<li>toasted whole almonds (36)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prepare cupcakes and bake according to instructions. Let cool completely.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, toast the coconut: spread into a baking sheet and bake at 350F for about 10 min, stirring constantly. Be careful not to let it burn. Let cool completely.</li>
<li>When everything's nice and cooled, it's time to assemble the chicks!</li>
<li>Frost the <em>bottom </em>andÂ sides of each cupcake and coat thoroughly/roll in coconut. (Note: I actually messed up and frosted the top and sides, hence my slightly squashed-looking chicks. Still yummy, though!)</li>
<li>For each chick, stick on 2 chocolate chips and an almond for the beak. Push two almond into the bottom for feet.</li>
<li>Repeat until you have a nice little coop of chickies :)</li>
<li>Eat, if you can bring yourself to do it!</li>
</ol>
