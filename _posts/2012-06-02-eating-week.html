<p style="text-align: center;">This week has left me, in a word, very, very, full</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">. And also, very, very excited to spend my Friday night in bed with the Netflix.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This week, there was...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Amorino Gelato, Union Square by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318115478/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318115478_6c1d13d449.jpg" alt="Amorino Gelato, Union Square" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">a <em>lot</em> of ice cream consumed. Goddammit, when the mercury rises New York becomes a veritable Sophie-trap with ice cream trucks on every corner. I have never been able to resist a good cone on the way home from work, and since this <em>is</em>Â Manhattan, we're not talking about the good stuff, not just Mr. Softee (although that always hits the spot!). This particular delightful specimen is from <a href="http://www.amorino.com/en/">Amornino Gelato</a>, near Union Square. It's Dark Chocolate, Tiramisu, and Hazelnut. Isn't she a beaut?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Squishy the Pug by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318117198/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318117198_bdf0236c9b.jpg" alt="Squishy the Pug" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">an overload of cuteness at the office. I swear to God, the company I work at could win some sort of cute dog competition. This here is Squishy the pug, and she lives up to her name indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318096584/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318096584_b04581f9d8.jpg" alt="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">many a bear at <a href="http://www.bareburger.com/">Bare Burger</a> a delicious organic burger mini-chain in NYC. (But no actual bears harmed in the noshing.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318096506/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318096506_96c25cd355.jpg" alt="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I opted for the veggie option and was NOT disappointed--BareBurger makes a mean meatless patty topped with lots of melty cheese, creamy avocado (my fave!), all on a sturdy multigrain bun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318096312/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318096312_fd2f1af674.jpg" alt="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It's called the California, and it was sunny indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318096690/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318096690_4c332e677e.jpg" alt="lunch at Bare Burger, NYC" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I couldn't resist trying one of their organic sodas on the menu, and the Blueberry Soda was the perfect touch to a delicious meal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="shrimp wonton soup noodles by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318115114/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318115114_5897824b67.jpg" alt="shrimp wonton soup noodles" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Both</em> wontons and ramen in my soup for dinner. Can't make up your mind? Then go for the Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup at <a href="http://www.noodlevillage.com/">Noodle Village</a>, in Chinatown. One note: it is a bit on the blander side, (although it's a good sign if you're tired of over-salty, MSG-laden packaged ramen).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="little dog in Chinatown by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7318117076/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7318117076_c1e7333cc7.jpg" alt="little dog in Chinatown" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And finally, another cute pup to close out the day, this one I spotted on the floor of a hair salon in C-town. She even had little barrettes in her fur!</p>
