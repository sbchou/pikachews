<p>First of all -- if you've landed here via my old url, www.mpetitchou.com -- no worries! This isn't a sneaky phishing scheme; you've come to the right place :)</p>
<p>Visitors new and old -- welcome to my food blog! Pika Chews is the mnemonic-friendly version of my old food blog, Mon Petit Chou. All old posts still exist here, so no worries if you wanted to revisit some of my old recipes (or high-school writing). After putting food blogging on hiatus due to an incredibly busy Junior year in college, and doing a short stunt on Tumblr, I'm back, to welcome in this summer (the season of barbeques, dining al fresco, and best of all, ICE CREAM) by blogging with renewed aplomb!</p>
<p><strong>What's new in the new blog?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Not much! My goal is to produce more quality writing in my posts. As I do live in NYC, in addition to recipes, I'll be focusing on more reviews of eateries and coffeeshops around the city, since I frequent many!</p>
<p><strong>What's on the plate for Pika?</strong></p>
<p>For fun and a little anticipation, here are some summer food-blogging projects i've got in mind!</p>
<p>1. A coffee tour of NYC<br />
As a computer scientist with a lot of STEM field friends, there's one thing we all adore: CAFFEINE! More specifically, the good stuff: coffee. As I am lucky to live in a city filled with independent and artisinal coffeeshops, not just the Green Mermaid, I'm going to do my best to keep track of all the caffeinated adventures, both store-brewed and home-ground.</p>
<p>2. A Chocolate Croissant Tour of NYC a.k.a. the Chocodex</p>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows that I have a humongous sweet tooth. My latest fixation? Chocolate croissants! The goal: to find and index all the <i>pain au chocolat</i> I nom. Bon Appetit!</p>
<p>3. Homemade Ice Cream</p>
<p>I am absolutely ice-cream obsessed so it's high time I tried making my own! Will I succeed? Will I fail? Keep reading to find out.</p>
