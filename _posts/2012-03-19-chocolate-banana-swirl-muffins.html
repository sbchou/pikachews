<p>Here's a fun and delicious alternative to a sweet breakfast staple: banana bread with a (chocolate) twist! To make Monday mornings a bit brighter, I also used a cute heart shaped tin to bake the muffins in, although a regular cupcake tin or large loaf pan will work just fine. This recipe is very moist, thanks to the applesauce and plentiful bananas (it contains no added fat or eggs!). The cocoa cake is full of chocolate flavor and makes a delicious and pretty contrast to the bananas.</p>
