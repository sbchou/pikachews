<p>Ah, home sweet home! After a grueling exams week, I'm finally back in Jersey. Well, for a week at least--I move in to start my summer fellowship program Sunday (more on that later).</p>
<p>Of course I put no time to waste in indulging in all the best things about break: banana chocolate-chip pancakes for breakfast, slurping down my favorite banana-cocoa smoothies twice a day, taking the scissors to the closet, lovingly harassing the cat, taking 3-hour naps, and watching many re-runs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_'70s_Show">that 70's show</a>. And, naturally, baking cookies!</p>
<p>I adore candied ginger and these cookies were inspired by my addiction to the spicy sweet taste. I used mini chocolate chips for more uniform chocolate per bite (it's all about the math, folks). Because they don't contain any added fat or egg, these cookies end up being very, very moist, which is a great thing taste-wise, but not so great if you want to transport or store them for too long. So eat 'em while they're warm and spicy, with a friend or two to share with!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Ginger Chocolate-Chip Banana Softies</em><br />
Makes about 16 cookies<br />
<a href="http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=15687.0"> Adapted from VegWeb</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 ¼ c whole wheat flour<br />
½ t baking soda<br />
½ t salt<br />
1 very ripe banana<br />
½ c unsweetened applesauce (1 snack-pack)<br />
½ c sugar<br />
1 t vanilla<br />
½ c crystallized ginger, chopped<br />
⅓ c mini chocolate chips</p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, mash banana. Stir in applesauce, sugar, and vanilla. Gradually stir in dry mixture, mixing well after each addition, until smooth. Fold in ginger and chocolate chips.</li>
<li>Drop heaping tablespoons of batter 2” apart on prepared pans.</li>
<li>Bake for 12-15 min, or until slightly browned and firm to touch.</li>
<li>Cool completely on wire racks before attempting to remove from parchment or transport. They are very soft!</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The original recipe called for baking powder too, but I totally forgot to add it! Maybe it would have turned out a bit puffier?</li>
