<p>This was my first attempt at making seitan "faux meat", and i'm pleasantly surprised. Although wouldn't fool a meat eater, and i am admittedly a seitan-lover, it has a nice spice blend, slices well and has a pleasing, "meaty" texture. I used a bit of an ad-lib recipe, based on several other ones from Vegan Dad and the PPK. I didn't use any nutritional yeast (can't get any around here!), which seems to be a common ingredient in many "sausage" recipes, so perhaps that would have improved the flavor.</p>
