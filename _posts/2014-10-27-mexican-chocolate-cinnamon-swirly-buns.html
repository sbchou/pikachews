<em>Everyone will like you if you come bearing hot (cinnamon) buns.</em></p>
<p>There are tiny kitchen challenges, and then there are really tiny kitchen challenges.</p>
<p>Case in point: my gentleman caller’s lovely but miniscule shoebox in Soho. We call it the space cabin, but there’s probably more counter space in space.</p>

<em>Only in New York.</em></p>
<p>There was also the additional challenge of being in the apartment of someone who until last week survived solely on takeout from Seamless. No icing sugar, no cake pan, no rolling pin, and definitely no yeast, only some leftover ingredients from last visit’s pancake production.</p>

<em>Exhibit A: the Manhattanite's rolling pin</em></p>
<p>One thing we did have was this amazing Mexican chocolate that I am now completely addicted to: it’s like crunchy sugar granules mixed in with dark chocolate and cinnamon-- heaven. Ironically, the Mexican chocolate also did not come from the resident Mexican. (Sometimes my life doesn’t make much sense but it’s all tasty.)</p>

<p>But I had a craving for the perfect Sunday morning: cinnamon buns, coffee; and no one could stop me. So I made do.</p>
<p><strong>Mexican Chocolate Cinnamon Swirly Buns</strong><br />
<a title="Mexican chocolate cinnamon swirl biscuits by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/15459579038"><img alt="Mexican chocolate cinnamon swirl biscuits" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15459579038_0be31c21f9_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Makes 12 swirly buns</p>
<p><em>This recipe was an attempt at quick no-yeast cinnamon rolls but I didn’t have a cake pan, so I made them in a muffin tin. They didn’t turn out like soft fluffy cinnabuns at all-- but rather deliciously sugary biscuits with a crunchy top and moist center. It’s likely my oven was all whack and thus the crunchy tops but I promise they’ll be tasty no matter how accurate your temperature is. Next time i’ll probably go get more supplies to attempt the real deal but these biscuits were perfect with a cup of café au lait and friendship.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dough</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">2 cups flour</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">2 tablespoons sugar</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">4 teaspoons baking powder</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">1 teaspoon salt</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">3 tablespoons butter</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">3/4 cup milk</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Filling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">4 tablespoons butter</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">1 cup brown sugar</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">3 teaspoons cinnamon</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">2 bars Mexican chocolate (usually they have this to make hot chocolate with), roughly chopped</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Preheat oven to 400F and lightly grease a muffin tin.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Cut in softened butter, stir in milk; knead lightly to form a soft dough.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Meanwhile, mix butter, sugar and cinnamon for filling.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Drop a teaspoon of filling mix at the bottom of each muffin cup (I might skip this step next time because it sort of sticks and burns).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Roll out dough on a lightly floured into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Spread the remaining filling on the rolled out dough. Sprinkle the chocolate.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Roll up the rectangle, with a sharp knife slice into 12 rolls. Place each swirly-side up in a muffin cup.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Bake for 20-25 min at 400°F, or till lightly browned on top.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Serve warm with coffee and love. :)</span></li>
</ol>
