<p>It doesn't get much easier than this- just mix and bake.</p>

<p><em>Milk and Cereal Bars</em></p>
<p>makes 16</p>
<p>adapted from the lovely <a href="http://www.nigella.com/recipe/recipe_detail.aspx?rid=126">Nigella</a></p>
<ul>
<li>3 c quick oats</li>
<li>14 oz can sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>1 c toasted wheat germ</li>
<li>½ c sunflower seeds</li>
<li>½ c chopped walnuts</li>
<li>½ c raisins</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 350°. Line a 9x13” pan (or 2 8x6” pans) with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Mix all ingredients in a large bowl. Press mixture into prepared pan, and bake 20-25 minutes. Edges should be lightly browned. Cool completely before cutting into 16 bars.</p>
<p>The verdict:</p>
<p>These breakfast bars are sweet and chewy. They stay together nicely after cutting (which has often been an issue for me in granola bar recipes) and have a caramel-y, milky taste from the sweetened condensed milk. It tastes a lot like a bowl of oatmeal and raisins with milk, but in a handy to-go form. Try substituting different mix-ins- craisins, sliced almonds, coconut, etc.</p>
