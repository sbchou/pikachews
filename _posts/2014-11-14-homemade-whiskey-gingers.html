<p dir="ltr">Whiskey gingers are one of my all-time favorite drinks, right behind a classic Manhattan. It says “I’m feeling classy, but also a little bubbly, too”. Somewhere between “let me smoke this cigar alone in the study” and swing dancing in a polka-dot dress. At least that’s how I picture it in my head.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some people call this Jack-and-Ginger but I’m not a fan of Jack Daniels, it has too much of a distinct sickly-sweet taste for the lightness of ginger. I’m a huge fan of Knob Creek Bourbon but just about anything you like to drink is good. Bourbon lends itself perfectly to sweet things but I bet this would be nice with Rye as well. I used Maker’s Mark here.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Homemade Whiskey Gingers</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">adapted from <a href="http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2012/06/emmas-whiskey-ginger-recipe.html">a Beautiful Mess</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Makes: enough for a good time</p>
<p dir="ltr">The key to this recipe lies in the homemade ginger syrup. I can’t believe I never made simple syrups before; the freshness is 100x better than Ginger Ale or Ginger Beer you get elsewhere and dirt cheap too. The leftover’s great mixed with club soda for the best ginger ale you ever had in your life.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">1 liter of club soda</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ice cubes (we don’t want no stinkin’ crushed ice! bigger cubes are better)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">good drinking bourbon (I don’t know how much you limit yourself to so I’ll leave this open ended.)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">1 cup water</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">2 cups sugar (and extra if you wanna make candied ginger)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">1 really big gingerroot</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">For the ginger syrup:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Peel the ginger root and slice half of it super thinly, and grate the rest. Grating the ginger makes all the great (ha ha) flavor come out but also makes the syrup (and thus your drink) a bit murky-looking, which is fine by me. If this bothers you, either strain it, or slice all the ginger and cook it for longer.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In a pot mix sugar, water. Over medium heat stir until sugar dissolves. Add ginger and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Cool slightly; strain syrup, reserving ginger slices and store in fridge for up to a month (it won’t last that long).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Coat the remaining ginger slices in sugar and lay out to dry. Now you have candied ginger! Yey!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Time to make the drinks:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I confess I never measure things when I make drinks. I just eyeball it. So it went something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Pour 1 shot of Maker’s into your glass</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Mix with 2 shots syrup</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Put big ice cubes in it</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Pour enough club soda to fill the glass. I always use Old Fashioned glasses because that’s all I drink. You should probably use a Highball glass.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The end!</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Seriously, just make it something like 1:2:4 Whiskey: syrup: soda and you should be good.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Or ask your friends who bartend for their advice, but you can't go wrong.</li>
</ul>
