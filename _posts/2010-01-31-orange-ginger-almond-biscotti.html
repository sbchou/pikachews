<p><a href="http://monpetitchoublog.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1201.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-295" title="IMG_1201" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_1201.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Biscotti with almonds, orange zest, and crystallized ginger. I used <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/154/Biscotti">this basic recipe </a>from "<a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/">Cooking for Engineers</a>" (which is a very funny and useful website, by the way), replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup, used whole raw almonds, and added 1/4 cup chopped crystallized ginger. The biscotti were very pretty and quite delicious. They were on the hard side so next time I would probably cut them thinner and Â double the ginger since I like it so much.</p>
