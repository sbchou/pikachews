<p>I love everything about the holidays (minus religion, eradication of native americans, children sitting on the laps of old men, and shopping malls). I love giving gifts and I love eating turkey and I love staying up on New Year’s Eve. But what I love most of all (aside from family and being incredibly thankful) is the opportunity to bake as many cookies as possible in the name of goodwill unto all.</p>
<p>Slice-and-bake cookies are the best of all, because in addition to being adorably retro, if you plan carefully, you’ll have enough cookie dough stashed in the freezer to keep the kitchen continuously perfumed from now till Christmas eve. This, ladies and gents, is what I call true holiday spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Chocolate Dipped Rosemary Shortbread with Sea Salt</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 2 dozen small (1”, bite-size) shortbread cookies</em></p>

<p>Shortbread cookies are cookies in their purest and most basic form: butter, sugar, flour, salt. As such, they are heavenly, the platonic ideal of cookies. In this version, I add a little rosemary for a sophisticated, savory layer of depth and dip them in dark chocolate for elegant gift giving. You can omit the extra step and the herbs for a wonderful basic shortbread, or add chocolate chips, walnuts, or even funfetti sprinkles. Enjoy!</p>
<p>HOW TO MAKE:</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, cream together:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">1 stick (½ cup) sweet cream butter, softened</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">¼ tsp salt (if butter is not salted)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">¼ cup powdered sugar</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Stir in:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">1 cup AP flour (King Arthur)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">1 tsp crushed rosemary (*dried, if using fresh, triple amount)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Just to combine.</p>
<p>Cut two sheets of plastic wrap, and divide dough in half. Shape each dough ball into a squared-off log of 1” diameter. Seal ends, and stick it in the freezer until firm or up to a month (!!).</p>
<p>When you’re ready to bake:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Preheat oven to 350F and line baking sheets with parchment.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Slice logs into ½ inch rounds and space on sheet 1 inch apart</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Bake 10-12 minutes, until very lightly browned around edges only.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Cool on the sheet for 5 min, and transfer to a wire rack for further cooling.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For chocolate coating:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Melt 1 cup dark chocolate chips over a double boiler, and dip cookies (cooled) on the diagonal.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Sprinkle with flaky sea salt.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Let cool in the fridge (or vestibule) until chocolate is firm.</span></li>
</ul>
