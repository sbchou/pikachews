<p>On Sunday I woke up and inspired by my roommate who was cleaning the room, full nesting mode was <em>on</em>. After a quick trip to the gym (going to the gym for Sophie is a rare occurrence and has never persisted for more than half an hour. I much prefer yoga and dancing--the treadmill is just so boring!), I went to Whole Foods, leaving triumphant with an armful's worth of veggies and other feel-good foods. Plus two pretty shades of summery polish from Walgreens for just $2.99 each!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabocha">Kabocha squash </a> is definitely one of my favorite veggies (and I think I may have converted my suitemate, too!). Any way you make it, it's an extremely dense, creamy, and sweet squash -- nothing like the old Jack'O Lantern. Since I had a bit of time, I decided to compare two cooking methods: simmered sweet &amp; savory on the stovetop, and roasted (along with the seeds!) sprinkled with cinnamon.</p>
<p><a title="sweet &amp; savory stewed kabocha by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/7491369498/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7491369498_817c69a8be.jpg" alt="sweet &amp; savory stewed kabocha" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>For cooking method Number One, simply chop up the pumpkin into nice chunks, cover with about 3/4 cup of water, a tablespoon of soy sauce, and a dash of sugar. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until all liquid is gone.</p>

<p>The key here is patience! About half an hour, so that the pumpkin is really soft and tender. So delicious! The whole thing melts in the mouth--skin, too.</p>

<p>For Part Two, I amped the oven on to 400F and, again, chopped up the squash, coating with a thin layer of olive oil (same for seeds). After spreading on a baking sheet, I sprinkled the squash with a touch of cinnamon, and the seeds with some cumin. Then, I let it go for at least 20 minutes, or until browned and fork-tender.</p>

<p>The verdict? Both were fantastic, but I preferred the stewing method (a bit more traditional/Asian taste).  Since the squash is already very dry and sweet, roasting made it dry out even more.</p>

<p>In elementary school my kindergarten teacher would dress up as a pumpkin every year and tell her students that it was because she ate too much pumpkin. I'm starting to feel like a pumpkin myself right about now, because this kabocha recipe is just so damn addictive. I ate half the whole thing for dinner yesterday, and the other half today in any easy  noodle soup: leftover udon, frozen mixed veggies, and yesterday's pumpkin boiled in some water, plus one raw egg beaten into the broth for egg drop.</p>
<p>A comforting dinner &amp; the perfect salve for Mondays!</p>
