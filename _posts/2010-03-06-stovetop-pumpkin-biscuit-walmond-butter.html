<p>Please excuse the over-flashed photo, usually I’m a style over substance kind of girl but I was halfway through devouring the last biscuit when I remembered that I should probably take a picture. These biscuits were a last minute kind of thing—I was planning to make pumpkin pancakes based off of this recipe (my fave) but then the batter turned out too thick and you know how it is.</p>
<p>These are surprisingly delicious—moist, tender, and savoury, with a slightly sweet taste from the cinnamon.</p>
<p>PS: I’m not sure if the amounts below are entirely correct since I’m working from memory here, but your results should be tasty regardless.</p>
<p>stovetop pumpkin biscuits (makes 8 )</p>
<p>•	1 c whole wheat flour</p>
<p>•	1 T sugar</p>
<p>•	2 t baking powder</p>
<p>•	1/8 t salt</p>
<p>•	¾ c pumpkin puree</p>
<p>•	¼ c soymilk</p>
<p>•	2 T oil</p>
<p>Heat a lightly greased nonstick skillet over medium heat. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in pumpkin, soymilk, and oil.</p>
<p>Scoop ¼ cupfuls of the batter onto pan. Cover with lid and cook for ~4 min, or until set, then flip over and cook ~4 more min, until cooked through. Serve hot with margarine, maple syrup, or almond butter (that’s what I choose).</p>
<p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge and reheat in the toaster oven till crispy.</p>
