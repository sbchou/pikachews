<p>Oh Trader Joe's, how I love you.<br />
I love you even when your line wraps all the way around to the milk aisle and you make my weekly grocery bill double.<br />
How could I not be inspired to whip up something special?</p>
<p><em>Lemon Pepper Mahi Mahi with Balsamic Baby Zucchini &amp; Whole Wheat Couscous</em></p>
<p><a title="lemon pepper mahi mahi, balsamic baby zucchini &amp; couscous by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6786105025/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6786105025_c5fe866ab0.jpg" alt="lemon pepper mahi mahi, balsamic baby zucchini &amp; couscous" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>This was an ad-lib sort of meal that went something like this:</p>
<p><a title="baby zucchini by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6786104423/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6786104423_182c323089.jpg" alt="baby zucchini" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>1. Get thee a bag of adorable little baby zucchini. Try not to feel too bad about eating them all about.</p>
<p><a title="baby zucchini by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6786103851/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6786103851_f1b47eb48d.jpg" alt="baby zucchini" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>2. Slice them in half lengthwise (ignore the screaming). Sautee with olive oil, a good sprinkling of salt &amp; pepper, &amp; douse with Lemon Pepper Mrs. Dash seasoning. When nice and browned, drizzle on some good balsamic vinegar and cook until reduced. (I might omit the vinegar next time: it was yummy but the flavor of the zucchini was so delicate some of it was overwhelmed.)</p>
<p><a title="frozen mahi mahi by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6786103289/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6786103289_88478123ab.jpg" alt="frozen mahi mahi" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>3. Meanwhile, defrost your frozen Mahi Mahi steaks under cold running water.</p>
<p>4. When it is all nice and defrosted open up the package and curse the manufacturing for putting the cooking instructions <em>inside</em>Â the wrapping so you had to google "how to cook frozen mahi mahi" for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>5. Sautee for about 3 min a side in a pan drizzled with olive oil, and sprinkled with salt, pepper, and once again, lemon pepper seasoning (poor man's lemons?), until fish is opaque but not dry.</p>
<p>6. Win friends and influence people OR shut door and enjoy all to yourself. (I choose the latter.)</p>
<p>(Sorry for the lack of real recipe: just be creative and it will be delicious, I promise! Voila the magic of Trader Joe's.)</p>
