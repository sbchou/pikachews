<p>what has Mon Petit Chou been up to lately?</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.mpetitchou.com/category/fashion-friday/">Fashion Friday</a> is dead (long live Fashion Friday!). Thanks to slow suffocation by finals and cold weather, my semester-long weekly fashion posts are now at an end. Will this be forever? Likely not, as eventually I will have to stop wearing glasses and messy buns and put on some pants. However, the weekly format has been, for now, put off.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/sets/72157628236834033/with/6461735809/">Petit Doodles!</a> Check out the right sidebar for little doodles done by me. Most of them may or may not have been drawn during Data Structures and Physics Lab on my iPhone.</p>
<p>3. I've been working on a simple Django web app for the past few days. By working I mean hacking, armed with Google and my very limited knowledge of web development, trying to make deadlines so I can be employed for the summer.</p>
<p>4. Latest obsession: <a href="http://www.girlwiththedragontattoo.com/">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>! Before I left for home I saw the American movie with some college buddies, and now I'm desperately trying to get my hands on a copy of the book (the library's all out!). It was a tad (by tad I mean 1000 times) more violent/scary than my usual taste, but I'm in love with Lisbeth Salander. Does anyone else feel the same way? I mean, come on, she's all sorts of lesbian/anti-authoritarian/feminist/hacker awesome. Like all my favorite things, and badass too. And there was a cat in the movie! Except the cat died. And Lisbeth gets raped. And yeah, lots of bad stuff happens.</p>
<p>5. Sophie is reunited with Nummy. See photo above. Nummy may or may not like this.</p>
