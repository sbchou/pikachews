<p>Last summer I interned at the online gaming company, <a href="http://www.omgpop.com ">OMGPOP</a>. It was a great experience--when else do you get to play games on the job?? Not to mention the awesome co-workers!</p>
<p>Today's recipe is inspired by one of my favorite games on the site: <a href="http://www.omgpop.com/games/dinglepop">Dinglepop</a>!</p>
<p>They're mini homemade funfetti cupcakes decorated to look like the dingles. It's a lot simpler than it looks, and a great treat for any gamer friends you may have.</p>
<p><em>Dinglepopcakes Tutorial</em></p>
<p>Makes about 48</p>
<p><em>Supplies:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1 batch of your favorite white cake recipe (you can use boxed cake mix--I'm just a from-scratch sort of girl :) )</li>
<li>1 recipe your favorite vanilla frosting (again, a can of vanilla frosting will do the trick!)</li>
<li>red, blue, and yellow food coloring</li>
<li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
<li>a mini-muffin tin</li>
<li>mini-cupcake liners</li>
</ul>
<div><em>Directions:</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>Mix up your cake batter according to the recipe or boxed directions. For fun, I threw in a handful of rainbow sprinkles, for instant funfetti!</div>

<p>Scoop into lined muffin cups, and bake for about 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees. Let them cool completely on wire racks.</p>
<p><a title="dinglepopcakes! by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6643080609/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6643080609_2b4f8c92c8.jpg" alt="dinglepopcakes!" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, make the frosting!</p>
<p>Separate into five bowls, and stir in yellow food coloring into one, blue in another, and a combination ofÂ red + blue in the third until you get purple, and the same for green (blue + yellow) and orange (yellow + red). The toughest part of this whole project was getting the colors right--food coloring tends to look a bit muted once you stir it into frosting, and in the end my colors weren't exactly like those in the game, but don't worry, it will be tasty regardless!<br />
For simplicity's sake, I only made three colors of dingles, but since you're less of a slacker than I am, you should make all five :)</p>

<p>Now, frost away!</p>
<p><a title="dinglepopcakes! by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6643082287/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6643082287_356e619485.jpg" alt="dinglepopcakes!" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>

<p>Once you're all done frosting (whew!) melt the chocolate chips in a small microwavable bowl in the microwave for about 30 -60 seconds, stirring until the chocolate's melted smooth.</p>

<p>Now for the fun part: using a toothpick, draw two small lines on each cupcake for "eyes".</p>

<p>Leave your cupcakes be and play a few games of Dinglepop so that the chocolate will harden and set.</p>

<p>Feel free to arrange them into fun gameplays!</p>
