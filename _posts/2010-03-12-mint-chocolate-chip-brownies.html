<p>Forgive me father, for I have sinned.</p>
<p>I put non-vegan mint chips into a vegan brownie.</p>
<p>But you can <a href="http://www.veggieconquest.com/archives/389">TJ’s Mint UFO’s</a> instead, those are 100% vegan.</p>

<p><strong>Vegan-ish Mint Chocolate Chip Brownies (makes 12 squares)</strong></p>
<p>adapted from <a href="http://www.thecraftykook.com/2010/03/eureka-brownies.html">these</a></p>
<p>3/4 cup sugar<br />
1/4 cup canola oil<br />
1/2 cup soy milk<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour<br />
1/2 cup cocoa powder<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
1/2 cup chocolate chips (I used Nestle’s dark chocolate and mint mix)</p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease an 8      inch square baking dish (I used a 6x8” Pyrex pan).</li>
<li>Mix sugar, oil, soymilk, and vanilla. Stir and set      aside to let sugar dissolve. (The original recipe called for      grinding the sugar to help it dissolve easier. I didn’t bother and it      turned out fine.)</li>
<li>Stir together the flour, cocoa powder, baking      powder, salt, and chocolate chips.</li>
<li>Pour the sugar mixture on top of the flour mix and      gently stir until just until combined.</li>
<li>Spoon the batter into the prepared baking dish and      spread it evenly.</li>
<li>Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until a toothpick      inserted in the middle comes out with a few moist crumbs attached but not      gooey. (I had to bake it for about 25 min. because of the different pan      size.)</li>
<li>Cool completely before cutting and serving. They      are complete goo when warm (they will firm up after chilling), but also      delicious, so if you don’t mind a mess…</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>I have been trying to find a good vegan brownie recipe for a long time and these were definitely a bit of an “Eureka!” like the recipe promised. They were almost exactly like non-vegan fudge brownies, even the ones choc-full of butter and eggs. After cooling, they have a great texture and hold together. Even though they are 100% whole wheat, they definitely don’t taste like it and are super-super decadent. I got rave reviews from my classmates and omnivorous friends.</p>
<p>The only caveat for me is that these are very sweet—not any more so than box mix brownies, but I am going to try to use ½ cup sugar next time to see what happens.</p>
<p>UPDATE: two days later I went to a friend's house and ate brownies from a box mix, so I can assure you that yeah, these are the real thing.</p>
