<p style="text-align: left;">Schoolwork has definitely been amping up to full volume now and that in combination with attempts to keep a small budget is my excuse for the lack of creative/real recipes lately.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But  sometimes simpler is better!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="hummus &amp; tomato tartine by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6198730843/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6198730843_a12a52db25.jpg" alt="hummus &amp; tomato tartine" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here was a quick lunch I had last week: sundried tomato hummus and fresh tomatoes on a slice of baguette. (Tartine is just a fancy French word for open-face sandwich! Sounds nice, doesn't it?)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The best part?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was almost completely free. I had worked an event at the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/german/deutsches-haus/">Deutsches Haus</a> that night and got to take all the yummy leftover hors d'oeuvres home: fresh baguettes, cheese, and this lovely hummus (I adore sundried tomatoes!).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not much of a recipe, but it was delicious!</p>
