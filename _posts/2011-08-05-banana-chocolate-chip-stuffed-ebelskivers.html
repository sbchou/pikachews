<p>The other day I went to Target to get a few essentials (and by essentials I mean a jumbo pack of Dentyne Ice, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bossypants-Tina-Fey/dp/0316056863">Tina Fey's new autobiography</a>, and <a href="http://www.worldwidefred.com/m-cups.htm">Matryoshka-shaped measuring cups</a>) and happened upon the cutest little ebelskiver pan you ever saw. Naturally I just had to buy it.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know, ebelskivers (or aebelskivers) are little round puffed Danish pancakes (that often contain some sort of filling) that require a special cast iron pan with little hemispherical indentations to make. In the US, they have been branded by As Seen on TV as "Pancake Puffsâ„¢", but since As Seen on TV is the harbringer of aggressively onomatopoeiac things such as Slap-Chop and Sham-Wow and Ninja Prep that frighten me, especially after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Offer">Vince Offer</a> was indicted for beating up a prostitute, it is in our best interest to never speak of that again.</p>
<p>I've had my eye on a number of tasty-looking recipes on the web, so I was quite excited to give my new pan a spin. It turned out to be so much quicker and easier than I thought! Not to mention delicious. The banana in the center becomes all soft and melty and makes such a tasty surprise. (Chocolate chips goes without saying.) I know this lowers my coolness factor by about 200 points, but I always feel like a kid on Christmas morning when I get new kitchen equipment. Except, oh wait, we didn't celebrate Christmas because it is a Capitalist Manifestation of Greed led by an Overweight Old Hoax and probably his team of Slap-Chop-Ninjas.*</p>
<p>Without further ado, the recipe:</p>

<p><em>Banana &amp; Chocolate Chip Stuffed Ebelskivers</em><br />
Makes 6 pancake-puffs<br />
(perfect for a hearty breakfast or snack!)</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 c whole wheat flour</li>
<li>1 t baking powder</li>
<li>1 T sugar</li>
<li>a dash of cinnamon</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
<li>1/2 c soymilk</li>
<li>1 t vegetable oil</li>
<li>a few banana slices and/or some chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Grease ebelskiver pan liberally and preheat over a medium flame.</li>
<li>In a large cereal bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Pour in soymilk and oil, and stir just until combined.</li>
<li>Drop a tablespoon of batter into each indent, top with a banana slice (or filling of choice), and cover with a bit more batter. Cook for 3-5 min, until edges are set, and flip over with chopsticks/tool of choice. Cook 2-3 min more, and carefully remove. Serve warm.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note:</p>
<p>Any old pancake recipe will do, I used my basic quick &amp; easy vegan one. Since my pan is rather petite feel free to double the recipe if you have a standard-sized pan with 7+ holes or would like to be generous and feed more than one person.</p>
<p>If you don't have an ebelskiver pan, do give it a second thought! I usually don't approve of uni-taskers, but there's just so much room for creativity (sweet and savory combinations and fillings).</p>
<p>*I jest. It is true that my Mother tried to shield us from the overcommercialized holidays, but that just made me love all things Christmas even more. Reverse psychology, anyone?</p>
