<p>Sundress Weather.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Someone should do research on the psychological effects of good weather on the floral prints lobe of the brain. Seriously.</p>
<p>Why am I writing about Sundress Weather amidst a torrential downpour as hurricane Irene slowly but menacingly makes its way up the East coast?</p>
<p>Because Sundress Weather is brief. Sundress Weather is fleeting. Sundress Weather is that small gap between when all the Frisbees start flying out on campus and when your ice cream liquefies before you even get to take a bite. The rest of the year is t-shirt and leggings weather. Spend 10 minutes getting ready in the morning (7 of them on trying to find that damn problem set I most definitely finished, I think…) weather. Trying not to hit people with my unwieldy bag of books weather.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the year also happens to coincide with my entire time at school, where I get to live with some of my greatest friends in what is no doubt the greatest city in the world. And, yes, try to survive midterms and projects and finals, all while constantly trying to remind convince myself that it’s doing me good.</p>
<p>Which is why, inspired by my talented and tech-savvy friend <a href="http://amritamaz.me/">Amrita</a>, I’m going to embark on a little fashion project. Because even if it is a-hurricaine-ing outside, it never hurts to bring a little Sundress Weather inside.</p>

</div>
<p>Here’s the plan:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Every Friday, for one semester (or longer if it turns out well!) I’ll post my most inspired outfit of the week on Mon Petit Chou. That way, I’ll be forced to get out of my t-shirt, even if it is just once a week. J</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">And for reference, here are a few of my thoughts on fashion…</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>I do not consider myself a very fashionable person. As in, although I like looking at magazines for inspiration and admire fashion as an art, I don’t really keep on top of fashion trends or make dressing up a huge part of my life. So my outfits will just be based on whatever I feel works well in my closet, plus whatever inspires me at the moment!</li>
<li>Minimalism and simplicity are very important to me. When I dress, I look for colors, patterns, shapes and cuts that work together well. I really don’t accessorize much.</li>
<li>I am a very petite person (hence Mon Petit Chou), and I try to wear things that suit my body. Therefore, my outfits may not work for everyone! On the other hand, featured in magazines and on mannequins may not always be the best for me.</li>
<li>Finally, please do keep in mind that I am not a very dress-up sort of girl. I don’t wear makeup on a daily basis, and as stated above, I spend about 10 minutes on average getting ready in the morning. But I hope you will find my outfits inspiring, and that you will inspire me to dress for sunny moods more often!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.S.: In other exciting news, Mon Petit Chou just needs 2 more likes to reach the 100-fan mark on Facebook! Maybe you will be lucky user 100? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mpetitchou">Check it out</a>-- it’s a great way to keep tabs on what’s cooking if you’re a Facebook user.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.P.S. Hope everyone stays indoors and safe in the stormy weather. Keep your fingers crossed for New York and the Tri-State area.</p>
