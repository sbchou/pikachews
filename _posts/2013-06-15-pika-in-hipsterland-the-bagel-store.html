<p>A sharp contrast to the vibe at <a href="http://www.pikachews.com/2013/06/pika-in-hipsterland-variety-coffeshop/">Variety Cafe</a>, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bagel-store-brooklyn">The Bagel Store</a> looks much more like your average hole-in-the-wall manhattan deli, with an attitude to match. No tattoed hipsters, no apathetic cute baristas, just brusque service, and damn good bagels. Just the way I like it.</p>
<p>WHAT TO GET:</p>
<p>The Bagel Store is famous for their unique flavors, especially the extremely rich Bacon, Egg & Cheese bagel (all baked right in!) and the French Toast bagel. As I have a sweet tooth extraordinaire, I got the French Toast bagel with Blueberry Cheesecake cream cheese, untoasted please. (They also have a wide assortment of cream cheese flavors!). The bagel had a lovely crispy shell, dusted with plentiful powdered sugar, and a cinnamon-raisin inside. The cream cheese was rich and delightful. It's definitely less traditional than my other favorite store, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/absolute-bagels-new-york">Absolute</a> near Columbia, but the flavors are well executed and the texture is straight-on. Next time, I'll give the plain bagel + cream cheese a try for a more standard comparison.</p>
