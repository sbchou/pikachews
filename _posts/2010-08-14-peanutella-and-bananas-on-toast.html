<p>Hi all! It’s been awhile, but the blog is back up and running*…expect vacation snapshots soon!</p>
<p>Here’s a little recipe to get you acclimated again:</p>
<p>Peanutella  (loosely based on Celine’s “<a href="http://havecakewilltravel.com/2010/06/07/i-cant-believe-its-nut-butter/">Altella</a>”)</p>
<p>Yield: approx. ½ cup</p>
<ul>
<li>¼ c granulated sugar**</li>
<li>¼ c chocolate chips</li>
<li>¼ c vanilla soymilk</li>
<li>¼ c natural peanut butter</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix sugar, chocolate chips, and soymilk in a medium sized microwavable bowl. Microwave about 1 min, or until chocolate and sugar are melted together, stirring occasionally. (You could also do this on the stovetop in a small saucepan.) Drizzle into the peanut butter, stirring until smooth and combined. When cool, store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks (not that it will last that long!) in an airtight container.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serve on toast (with bananas!), stir into a glass of soymilk for a great chocolate pb drink, warm it up and pour on ice cream, use as frosting, filling, or whatever lights your fancy…</li>
<li>You could even make <a href="http://havecakewilltravel.com/2010/08/03/halte-la/">these</a></li>
<li>Or how about stir some into mini chocolate cupcakes? But that’s another story…</li>
<li>True to Celine’s word, this spread is usable straight out of the fridge!</li>
<li>It has a great texture—it’s silky and smooth</li>
<li>100% vegan!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>*although unfortunately, the blog may face more obstacles in the near future…but we will cross that bridge when we come to it</p>
<p>**or you could make your life easier and use powdered sugar, which dissolves much more quickly and smoothly</p>
