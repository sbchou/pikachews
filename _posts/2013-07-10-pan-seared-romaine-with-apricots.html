<p><a title="Pan seared romaine with apricots by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/9250371579/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Pan seared romaine with apricots" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/9250371579_9254c57f14.jpg" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>At first, cooking lettuce of any sort seems so counterintuitive-- even sacrilegious. But getting over any initial fears is infinitely rewarding: a blast of high heat transforms ordinary salad greens into an savory side dish, and intensifies the sweetness of the leaves.</p>
<p>This is one of those recipes that transforms an assortment of unlikely ingredients into something magically delicious. I was literally throwing odds and ends into a pan in a moment of creativity and rather pleased at how it turned out. Grilling hearts of romaine is popular, but since I didn't have a grill (confined to small manhattan kitchens), I simply seared everything in a hot pan. The combination of crunchy, salty, sweet and spicy is perfect for a midsummer's day.</p>
<p><em>Pan-seared Romaine with Apricots and Red Pepper Flakes<br />
</em><br />
Serves: 2</p>
<p>* 1 large head of romaine, outer leaves peeled off<br />
* 4 sweet apricots<br />
* 2 T nutty olive oil<br />
* salt<br />
* red pepper flakes</p>
<ol>
<li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, clean the lettuce and chop into 1” strips, and pit and cut the apricots into half-moons.</li>
<li>When pan is very hot (you want to caramelize the leaves quickly so they don’t lose their crispness), throw in the romaine and apricots. Caramelize, tossing pan frequently so that it doesn’t burn.</li>
<li>Sprinkle red pepper and salt to taste, and serve warm.</li>
</ol>
