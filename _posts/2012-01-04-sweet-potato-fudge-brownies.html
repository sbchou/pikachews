<p>Happy New Year! I can hardly believe it's already 2012--12 whole years since the new millenium. I feel so old saying this, but there are times where I still think that 2000 sounds futuristic, and then I remember it's been more than a decade...<br />
With the new year comes the perfect opportunity to reflect on one's life, and perhaps make some changes.<br />
(I've been procrastinating as usual and still haven't made up my resolutions yet...hmm...maybe that would make a good resolution...)</p>
<p>Here's a lightened up fudge brownie recipe adapted from Martha Stewart (via <a href="http://www.neverhomemaker.com/">Neverhomemaker</a>) in honor of the New Year. It's made with sweet potatoes and vegan to boot but tastes totally decadent (so extremely chocolatey and FUDGY)! Perfect for those get-healthy resolutions...</p>
<p><em>Sweet Potato Fudge Brownies</em><br />
adapted from <a href="http://www.neverhomemaker.com/2011/03/sweet-potato-brownies.html">neverhomemaker</a></p>
<p>4 tablespoons canola oil<br />
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br />
1/2 cup all purpose flour (whole wheat pastry flour would be great, and healthier too!)<br />
1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
2/3 cup organic cane sugar<br />
2/3 cup sweet-potato puree<br />
1 flax egg (see directions below)<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
1/2 cup chocolate chips</p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F, and grease an 8" baking pan.</li>
<li>In a small microwave-safe bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon golden flax meal with three tablespoons water. Then heat on high for 30 seconds. Stir and set aside to cool.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
<li>In another bowl, combine the sweet potato puree with the oil, flax egg, vanilla, and sugar. Mix until smooth.</li>
<li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry. Mix until everything is well moistened and stir in the chocolate chips. (The dough will be a bit stiff and extremely fudgy!)</li>
<li>Spread into your prepared pan and bake for about 20 min, or until just set. (These brownies are extremely fudgy so a toothpick won't likely come out clean.)</li>
<li>Enjoy warm and gooey, or let cool a bit for easier slicing :)</li>
</ol>
