<p>I am something of a thrift store addict. I got hooked last summer working next door to the <a href="http://www.housingworks.org/">Housing Works thrift shop</a> in Soho and <a href="http://www.housingworks.org/bookstore?utm_source=shop_nav&amp;utm_medium=webpage">the magnificent used bookstore/cafe</a> next door (I am a used books fiend. My paycheck suffered.). I don't think I've ever walked into Housing Works without walking out with a new pair of shoes, but, hey, all for a good cause, right?</p>
<p>Walking down to Trader Joe's on a sunny day can turn dangerous as I am always tempted to stop at all the shops along the way, and last weekend was no exception. One of the best things about used clothing is the stories that are left behind with them.</p>

<p>I got this adorable <a href="http://usa.frenchconnection.com/index.aspx?mscsmigrated=true">French Connection</a> skirt for a mere $20, and just today, as I was reaching into the pocket, out comes two ticket stubs: one to the Fondation C. Monet, and another to the Musee Impressionnismes. French Connection, vraiment!</p>
