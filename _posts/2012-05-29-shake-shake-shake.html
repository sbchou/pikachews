<p>Yesterday my dear friend Lyndsey came to visit and we had quite a delicious day!<br />
We are both big fans of art and so we spent the whole afternoon exploring the MOMA. We managed to go through every room on every floor, in just a bit more than 2 hours!</p>

<p>After that we made a beeline for <a href="http://www.shakeshack.com/">Shake Shack</a>, New York's most popular burger and shake chain. Unfortunately, it's also a tourist favorite, and so the line for burgers was ridiculously long. We settled for sweets instead, since the line for cold food was much shorter.</p>

<p>This is a "Concrete", which according to Shake Shack's menu is "Dense frozen custard blended at high speed with toppings &amp; mix-ins". I got the Shack Attack® :Chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough and Mast Brothers Shake Shack blend chocolate, topped with chocolate sprinkles.</p>

<p>Lyndsey got good ol' plain chocolate, a familiar favorite.<br />
We both thought it was more like soft ice cream than a shake. In fact, I couldn't really tell what made it a "concrete". Of course, ice cream is always welcome on a hot, muggy day, but maybe I would just go for the cheaper alternative next time.</p>

<p>Thank goodness <a href="http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/news/blog/mad-sq-eats-is-back-and-were-hungry">Madison Square Eats</a> (a mini food stand fest) was going on across the street! All the food looked amazing, and I choose to try the vegetarian Mel + Steve (asian sesame slaw on top of veggie dog) from <a href="http://asiadognyc.com/">AsiaDog</a>, an Asian Fusion hot dog stand.</p>

<p>Lyndsey and I both agreed it was by far the prettiest hot dog (with the purple cabbage slaw) that we'd ever seen! And the taste was great, too :)</p>
<p>Note: Later that night I actually went to Shake Shack AGAIN, for a hackNY team-building event, and got to try the famous 'Shroom Burger (deep fried portabello stuffed with Muenster), with cheese fries on the side. They were to die for! I don't see anything great in the shakes, but the hot food at Shake Shack is greasy goodness.</p>
<p>This is how I felt after feasting all day:</p>
