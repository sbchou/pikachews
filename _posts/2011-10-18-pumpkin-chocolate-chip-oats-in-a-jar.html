Have you heard of the <a href=" (http://www.babble.com/best-recipes/cakes-and-baking/desserts-recipes-in-a-jar-cake/?page=10)">desserts-in-a-jar</a> trend lately?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think it's such a adorable and clever idea!<br />
Although nothing can beat the timelessness of a good old slab of chocolate layer cake, there's just something so charming and kitschy about glass jars. I'm quite a fan of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Spicy, warm, and comforting, this simple recipe is the perfect fall day treat. Stir it up in an old peanut butter jar like I did and you have a healthy and delicious breakfast (or dessert!) on the go.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Oats in a Jar</em><br />
Makes 1 serving<br />
-1/2 c instant oatmeal<br />
-1/2-1 c boiling water<br />
-1/4 c pumpkin puree (use the good stuff! Organic tastes better :) )<br />
-splash of milk or soy milk<br />
-dash of cinnamon<br />
-handful of chocolate chips</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Put the oatmeal in your jar or bowl, and pour boiling water over it (the amount depends on how thick you like it--I like mine nice and gooey). Now here's the hard part: let it sit for at least 10 minutes. The longer you let it sit, the thicker it will be. You could use the microwave or even a saucepan if you are impatient like me or you want to use old fashioned or steel cut oats, both of which are delicious.<br />
Once your oats are nice and thick, stir in the the pumpkin, a splash of milk, and the cinnamon.<br />
Sprinkle chocolate chips, give it a good stir, and savor with a cup of tea.</p>
