<p>It's been quite a hellish week for me at school...</p>
<p>But here are Thanksgiving photos, finally!</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays. Not only does it mark the beginning of the holiday season, it comes at a usually stressful time in the semester where taking a weekend off and putting it all in perspective  with the ones I love most is much needed.</p>
<p>And did I mention the food?</p>
<p><a title="thanksgiving menu! by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6408685317/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6408685317_fede8c2c74.jpg" alt="thanksgiving menu!" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>This was our fancy menu, planned out by my Aunt Joy, who every year hosts our holiday dinner and comes up with a delicious and creative theme!</p>
<p>This year, we went all-out Italian. The results were impressive, considering that none of us are the slightest bit Italian nor have had any experience with the cuisine!</p>
<p>First up:<br />
For lunch, a delicious Cioppino ( a hearty seafood stew full of shrimp, mussels, clam, crab, and scallops!) with homemade bread spiced with rosemary (courtesy of Uncle Ken).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">After filling ourselves to the brim with seafood, it was time to start cooking for the main event--Thanksgiving dinner!</p>
<p>This year, instead of the traditional turkey, we decided to throw a curveball by making roast pork instead--slow roasted in a dutch oven all day until the meat was tender and delicious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a glass of sparkling pomegranate juice, which was a lovely and light non-alcoholic alternative.</p>

<p>A light salad of arugula, raddichio, and romaine with aged balsamic dressing</p>

<p>One of my favorites: roasted root vegetables with thyme and oregano!</p>
<p>I absolutely adore roasted veggies, and this combination of parsnips, rutabaga, turnips, and sweet potato was superb.</p>
<p>(I'm still enjoying the leftovers at school!)</p>

<p>Peas studded with bits of fried pancetta and pine nuts was a sweet-and-salty delight.</p>

<p>Here's the roast pork, carved for the dinner table. It was so tender that it fell apart at the touch!</p>

<p><em>The set table</em></p>

<p><em>My dinner plate </em>(well, the first plate, anyway)</p>
<p><em></em><a title="thanksgiving dinner 2011 by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6408734327/"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6408734327_e5a6f0d4ed.jpg" alt="thanksgiving dinner 2011" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, dessert time!<br />
My aunt and uncle made an impressive "Crostata di Mele con Frangipane"--apple tart with homemade frangipane!<br />
It was so beautiful and rich.</p>

<p>We topped it off with vanilla gelato!<br />

<p>After that...a nap!</p>
<p>It was so much fun to prepare and eat such an elaborate feast.</p>
<p>Something about being away at college and living on my own definitely makes me appreciate a nice warm homemade meal that much more.</p>
