<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>I just recently finished <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com">Ree's</a> novel, The Pioneer Woman: Black Heels to Tractor Wheels.</p>
<p>I have to admit, although I love Ree's blog (great photos, adorable family, and mouthwatering recipes!), her book just wasn't my cup of tea. Perhaps I'm just too young, and too much of a cynic and a realist when it comes to romantics.</p>
<p>In any case, this beautiful post of hers on cold brewing is definitely my cup of <del>tea</del> coffee: <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2011/06/perfect-iced-coffee/">http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2011/06/perfect-iced-coffee/</a></p>
<p>Thanks for the great step-by-step, Ree!</p>
