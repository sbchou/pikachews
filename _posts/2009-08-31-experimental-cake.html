<p>Steaming is a very versatile cooking technique that is commonly used in Asian cuisine (food is seldom baked). For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi">baozi</a>, like <a href="http://www.justhungry.com/2004/04/steamed_buns_wi.html?page=2">char siu bao</a>, are very popular items, as are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantou">mantou</a>, steamed buns without any filling. Steaming is usually much quicker and efficient than baking, and it doesn’t heat up the kitchen during the summer. Since I tend to go for sweet instead of savory, I came up with this experimental steamed banana cake. It turned out very nice- fluffy, sweet, and moist, just like banana bread (and there’s no fat or eggs in it!).  I will have to try some more steamed desserts in the future.</p>

<p><em>Steamed Banana Cake</em></p>
<p>Makes 1 small cake, about 4 slices</p>
<ul>
<li>½ cup flour</li>
<li>¼ cup wheat germ*</li>
<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>2 tb brown sugar</li>
<li>1 ripe banana</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix flour, wheat germ, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl.</p>
<p>In another bowl, mash the banana with the sugar, then add to the dry mixture and stir to combine. Pour batter into a small bowl or baking pan (about 2 cup capacity). Steam on high heat over boiling water for about 15-20 min, until well-risen and firm. </p>
<p>* I put wheat germ in the cake to make it a healthier, breakfast-y item. You can’t really taste it, and the cake is still fluffy and nice., but you can subsite more flour instead.</p>
<p>Note: being an experimental cake and all, mine was a little undercooked on the bottom, so make sure to cook yours thoroughly, and do the toothpick test to be sure.</p>
