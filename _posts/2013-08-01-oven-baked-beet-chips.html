<p>I'm a huge fan of all sorts of roasted veggies-- but these have to be my favorite. The key is to slice them paper thin, and use a lower (350F) temperature, for amazing beautiful crispiness and a sweet taste. These make a lovely presentation-- the color is fantastic!</p>
<p><em>Roasted Beet Chips</em><br />
Serves 2 </p>
<p>* 2 large beets<br />
* olive oil<br />
* salt, pepper</p>
<p>1. Preheat oven to 350F. Note: I found this lower-than usual temperature for roasting veggies to be the best for optimizing crispiness without burning (at 400F, the chips burned too quickly).<br />
2. Scrub beets, peel, and slice *very* thinly, a mandoline is best.<br />
3. Dump beets onto baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and salt and pepper. Toss thoroughly, then lay out in *one thin layer, no overlap*.<br />
4. Bake for ~15 min, flip, and bake for ~15 minutes more, until lighter in color, considerably smaller in size, and crispy.</p>
