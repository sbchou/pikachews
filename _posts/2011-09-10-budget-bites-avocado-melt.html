<p style="text-align: left;">This year, as a sophomore, I am no longer required to subscribe to one of the University's extremely expensive &amp; less-than-gourmet meal plans, hooray! Although my overall budget allowance for food has shrunk drastically, to be honest, I'm loving it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It probably has to do with the fact that I absolutely detest being told what to do (I went on a cruise in Norway last year…and was miserable. Assigned tables, mealtimes, forget it! The fjords were quite lovely, though.) and would rather eat a good old pbj on my time than wait in line to get a plateful of mass-prepared mush.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nonetheless, living on $100 a month for groceries is no easy feat in New York City. Perhaps even more difficult is limiting my "fun" fund (restaurant/Starbucks/froyo budget) to the same amount. To help document the process, and make it more fun, I've created a new category called "budget bites" (you can access all the categories on the right sidebar!) where I'll share some of the cheap, easy, and good eats that I make with limited resources and equipment. Since it's already hard enough to keep healthy at school, most will be on the lighter side as well and probably vegetarian (I eat meat, but seldom cook it, and prefer vegetarian cuisine a lot of the time).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Without further ado, here's one of my favorite new discoveries!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="avocado melt by mpetitchou, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpetitchou/6133024611/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6133024611_064061fec3.jpg" alt="avocado melt" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Avocado Melt</em><br />
Serves 1</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>1 whole grain tortilla</li>
<li>1 slice Munster cheese (my favorite for it’s meltability &amp; mild &amp; creamy taste, but you can use whatever you’d like!)</li>
<li>¼ ripe avocado, sliced</li>
<li>Dijon mustard, to taste</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. Spread some mustard over tortilla, and top with cheese and avocado.<br />
2. Fold over to enclose filling, and microwave on High for 30 seconds.<br />
3. Eat warm and melty!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It doesn't get any easier than this. 30 seconds of cooking for gooey, cheesy, avocado bliss!</p>
