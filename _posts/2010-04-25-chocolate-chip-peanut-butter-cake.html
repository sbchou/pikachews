<p>Oatmeal every morning gets old very quickly, so I decided to whip up this easy Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Cake for a breakfast treat. The recipe is from <a href="http://vegkitchen.com/">Nava Atlas</a> and it is superb! The cake is very moist, peanut butter-y (but not cloying), and choc-full of chocolate chips. Plus, it’s relatively healthy, with no added fat aside from the pb, and vegan.</p>

<p><strong><em>Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Cake</em></strong><strong><br />
</strong>Makes 9 squares</p>
<p>original recipe<a href="http://vegkitchen.com/recipes/cakes-and-pies.htm"> here</a> (slightly modified below)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup whole wheat pastry flour (I used regular whole      wheat flour with great results)</li>
<li>1 1/2      teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/3      cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1/2      teaspoon salt (I reduced to ¼ tsp)</li>
<li>1/2      cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
<li>1/2      cup soymilk</li>
<li>1/2      cup natural peanut butter, at room temperature</li>
<li>1 cup      semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</p>
<p>Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a mixing bowl and stir together.</p>
<p>Combine the applesauce, soy milk, and peanut butter in another bowl and whisk together until smooth.</p>
<p>Pour into the flour mixture and stir together until fairly well blended. Stir in the chocolate chips.</p>
<p>Pour into a lightly oiled 9-inch round or square cake pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden on top, and a knife inserted into the center comes out with chocolate, but no batter.</p>
<p>Allow to cool to room temperature or just warm, then cut into squares or wedges to serve.</p>
